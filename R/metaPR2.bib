abstract = {Tailings ponds in the Athabasca oil sands (Canada) contain fluid wastes, generated by the extraction of bitumen from oil sands ores. Although the autochthonous prokaryotic communities have been relatively well characterised, almost nothing is known about microbial eukaryotes living in the anoxic soft sediments of tailings ponds or in the thin oxic layer of water that covers them. We carried out the first next-generation sequencing study of microbial eukaryotic diversity in oil sands tailings ponds. In metagenomes prepared from tailings sediment and surface water we detected very low numbers of sequences encoding eukaryotic small subunit ribosomal RNA representing seven major taxonomic groups of protists. We also produced and analyzed three amplicon-based 18S rRNA libraries prepared from sediment samples. These revealed a more diverse set of taxa, 169 different OTUs encompassing up to eleven higher-order groups of eukaryotes, according to detailed classification using homology searching and phylogenetic methods. The 10 most abundant OTUs accounted for {\textgreater}90{\%} of the total of reads, versus large numbers of rare OTUs ({\textless}1{\%} abundance). Despite the anoxic and hydrocarbon-enriched nature of the environment, the tailings ponds harbour complex communities of microbial eukaryotes indicating that these organisms should be taken into account when studying the microbiology of the oil sands.

abstract = {The marine diatom Leptocylindrus is a major component of phytoplankton blooms in coastal ecosystems and upwelling regions worldwide, however, little is known about this genus in the southern hemisphere. Whilst Leptocylindrus danicus has been reported from south-eastern (SE) Australia since the 1930s, there has been neither unequivocal species identification nor focused examination of the temporal abundance of Leptocylindrus in this region. Such investigations are crucial in the context of climate change and the strengthening of the East Australian Current, which is expected to result in alterations to the seasonal abundance and distribution of Leptocylindrus along the east Australian coast. Thus we also describe the temporal distribution of Leptocylindrus based on 50 years of records, revealing that this diatom is a key component of the seasonal phytoplankton cycle, with greatest abundance in the austral spring and summer. Using light and transmission electron microscopy and molecular phylogenetics based on the nuclear-encoded ITS1–5.8S–ITS2 rDNA region, our study unambiguously revealed three species, L. danicus, Leptocylindrus convexus and Leptocylindrus aporus from 34 clonal isolates from SE Australia, with the majority (82{\%}) of strains identified as L. danicus. Furthermore, we investigated the growth, auxospore and resting spore formation of the most commonly occurring species, L. danicus, under four temperature and irradiance scenarios. The diatom reached maximum growth rates (µMax, 1.71 divisions day−1) under relatively high temperatures (25°C) and light conditions (100 µmol photons m−2 s−1) between days 2 and 7 of the experiment. When temperature and light regimes were reduced (18°C, 50 µmol photons m−2 s−1) auxospores and resting spores were formed. The rapid growth rate and potential of L. danicus to form auxospores are important survival mechanisms in coastal upwelling systems and likely to result in the continued success of this species in Eastern Australia. The ecological, physiological and evolutionary response of this significant diatom group to further ocean warming should be the focus of future investigations.},

abstract = {Heard Island in the Southern Ocean is a biological hotspot that is suffering the effects of climate change. Significant glacier retreat has generated proglacial lagoons, some of which are open to the ocean. We used pyrotag sequencing of SSU rRNA genes and environmental data to characterize microorganisms from two pools adjacent to animal breeding areas, two glacial lagoons and Atlas Cove (marine site). The more abundant taxa included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, ciliates and picoflagellates (e.g. Micromonas), and relatively few Archaea. Seal Pool, which is rich in organic matter, was characterized by a heterotrophic degradative community, while the less eutrophic Atlas Pool had more eucaryotic primary producers. Brown Lagoon, with the lowest nutrient levels, had Eucarya and Bacteria predicted to be oligotrophs, possess small cell sizes, and have the ability to metabolize organic matter. The marine influence on Winston Lagoon was evident by its salinity and the abundance of marine-like Gammaproteobacteria, while also lacking typical marine eucaryotes indicating the system was still functioning as a distinct niche. This is the first microbiology study of Heard Island and revealed that communities are distinct at each location and heavily influenced by local environmental factors.},

abstract = {Bacterioplankton and protists fulfil key roles in marine ecosystems. Understanding the abundance and distribution of these organisms through space and time is a central focus of biological oceanographers. The role of oceanographic features, in addition to environmental conditions, in structuring bacterioplankton and protist communities has been increasingly recognised. We investigated patterns in bacterioplankton and protist diversity and community structure across the Southland Front system, a compaction of the subtropical front zone, to the east of New Zealand's South Island. We collected 24 seawater samples across a {\~{}}65 km transect and characterised bacterioplankton and protist community composition using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes, respectively. We identified frontal waters as a bacterioplankton diversity hotspot relative to neighbouring subtropical and subantarctic waters, but did not find evidence of this effect in protists. Bacterioplankton showed pronounced spatial structuring across the front, with communities closely tracking water type through the region. Protist communities also tracked water type through the region, though this effect was substantially less pronounced. We used an ecological null model approach to demonstrate that protist communities are primarily assembled through stochastic processes, whilst bacterioplankton are primarily assembled through deterministic processes across the Southland Front system. We suggest that this divergence emerges from fundamental differences in the characteristics of bacterioplankton and protist communities. Our findings add to a growing body of literature highlighting the importance of oceanographic features in shaping bacterioplankton and protist communities, promoting the necessity for such features to be considered more explicitly in the future.},

abstract = {Syndiniales are a ubiquitous group of protist parasites that infect and kill a wide range of hosts, including harmful bloom-forming dinoflagellates. Despite the importance of parasitism as an agent of plankton mortality, parasite-host dynamics remain poorly understood, especially over time, hindering the inclusion of parasitism in food web and ecosystem models. For a full year in the Skidaway River Estuary (Georgia), we employed weekly 18S rRNA sampling and co-occurrence network analysis to characterize temporal parasite-host infection dynamics of Syndiniales. Over the year, Syndiniales exhibited strong temporal variability, with higher relative abundance from June to October (7 to 28{\%}) than other months in the year (0.01{\%} to 6{\%}). Nonmetric dimensional scaling of Syndiniales composition revealed tight clustering in June to October that coincided with elevated temperatures (23 to 31°C), though in general, abiotic factors poorly explained composition (canonical correspondence analysis [CCA] and partial least-squares [PLS]) and were less important in the network than biotic relationships. Syndiniales amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were well represented in the co-occurrence network (20{\%} of edges) and had significant positive associations (Spearman r {\textgreater} 0.7), inferred to be putative parasite-host relationships, with known dinoflagellate hosts (e.g., Akashiwo and Gymnodinium ) and other protist groups (e.g., ciliates, radiolarians, and diatoms). Positive associations rarely involved a single Syndiniales and dinoflagellate species, implying flexible parasite-host infection dynamics. These findings provide insight into the temporal dynamics of Syndiniales over a full year and reinforce the importance of single-celled parasites in driving plankton population dynamics. Further empirical work is needed to confirm network interactions and to incorporate parasitism within the context of ecosystem models.},

abstract = {Ancient lakes are among the most interesting models for evolution studies because their biodiversity is the result of a complex combination of migration and speciation. Here, we investigate the origin of single celled planktonic eukaryotes from the oldest lake in the world—Lake Baikal (Russia). By using 18S rDNA metabarcoding, we recovered 1414 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to protists populating surface waters (1–50 m) and representing pico/nano-sized cells. The recovered communities resembled other lacustrine freshwater assemblages found elsewhere, especially the taxonomically unclassified protists. However, our results suggest that a fraction of Baikal protists could belong to glacial relicts and have close relationships with marine/brackish species. Moreover, our results suggest that rapid radiation may have occurred among some protist taxa, partially mirroring what was already shown for multicellular organisms in Lake Baikal. We found 16{\%} of the OTUs belonging to potential species flocks in Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Opisthokonta, Archaeplastida, Rhizaria, and Hacrobia. Putative flocks predominated in Chrysophytes, which are highly diverse in Lake Baikal. Also, the 18S rDNA of a number of species (7{\%} of the total) differed {\textgreater}10{\%} from other known sequences. These taxa as well as those belonging to the flocks may be endemic to Lake Baikal. Overall, our study points to novel diversity of planktonic protists in Lake Baikal, some of which may have emerged in situ after evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {In the marine realm, biomonitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) of benthic communities requires destructive direct sampling or the setting-up of settlement structures. Comparatively much less effort is required to sample the water column, which can be accessed remotely. In this study we assess the feasibility of obtaining information from the eukaryotic benthic communities by sampling the adjacent water layer. We studied two different rocky-substrate benthic communities with a technique based on quadrat sampling. We also took replicate water samples at four distances (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 20 m) from the benthic habitat. Using broad range primers to amplify a ca. 313 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene, we obtained a total of 3,543 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs). The structure obtained in the two environments was markedly different, with Metazoa, Archaeplastida and Stramenopiles being the most diverse groups in benthic samples, and Hacrobia, Metazoa and Alveolata in the water. Only 265 MOTUs (7.5{\%}) were shared between benthos and water samples and, of these, 180 (5.1{\%}) were identified as benthic taxa that left their DNA in the water. Most of them were found immediately adjacent to the benthos, and their number decreased as we moved apart from the benthic habitat. It was concluded that water eDNA, even in the close vicinity of the benthos, was a poor proxy for the analysis of benthic structure, and that direct sampling methods are required for monitoring these complex communities via metabarcoding.},

abstract = {Marine biofilms are known to influence the corrosion of metal surfaces in the marine environment. Despite some recent research, the succession of bacterial communities colonizing artificial surfaces remains uncharacterized in some temporal settings. More specifically, it is not fully known if bacterial colonizers of artificial surfaces are similar or distinct in the different seasons of the year. In particular the study of early biofilms, in which the bacterial cells communities first adhere to artificial surfaces, are crucial for the development of the subsequent biofilm communities. In this work, we used amplicon-based NGS (next-generation sequencing) and universal 16S rRNA bacterial primers to characterize the early biofilm bacterial communities growing on 316 L stainless steel surfaces in a Northern Portugal port. Sampling spanned 30-day periods in two distinct seasons (spring and winter). Biofilm communities growing in steel surfaces covered with an anti-corrosion paint and planktonic communities from the same location were also characterized. Our results demonstrated that distinct temporal patterns were observed in the sampled seasons. Specifically, a significantly higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Mollicutes was found on the first days of biofilm growth in spring (day 1 to day 4) and a higher abundance of Alphaproteobacteria during the same days of biofilm growth in winter. In the last sampled day (day 30), the spring biofilms significantly shifted toward a dominance of photoautotrophic groups (mostly diatoms) and were also colonized by some macrofouling communities, something not observed during the winter sampling. Our results revealed that bacterial composition in the biofilms was particularly affected by the sampled day of the specific season, more so than the overall effect of the season or overall sampling day of both seasons. Additionally, the application of a non-fouling-release anti-corrosion paint in the steel plates resulted in a significantly lower diversity compared with plates without paint, but this was only observed during spring. We suggest that temporal succession of marine biofilm communities should be taken in consideration for future antifouling/anti-biofilm applications.},

abstract = {Recently, several studies demonstrated the usefulness of diatom eDNA metabarcoding as an alternative to assess the ecological quality of rivers and streams. However, the choice of the taxonomic marker as well as the methodology for data analysis differ between these studies, hampering the comparison of their results and effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare two taxonomic markers commonly used in diatom metabarcoding and three distinct analytical approaches to infer a molecular diatom index. We used the values of classical morphological diatom index as a benchmark for this comparison. We amplified and sequenced both a fragment of the rbcL gene and the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene for 112 epilithic samples from Swiss and French rivers. We inferred index values using three analytical approaches: by computing it directly from taxonomically assigned sequences, by calibrating de novo the ecovalues of all metabarcodes, and by using a supervised machine learning algorithm to train predictive models. In general, the values of index obtained using the two “taxonomy-free” approaches, encompassing molecular assignment and machine learning, were closer correlated to the values of the morphological index than the values based on taxonomically assigned sequences. The correlations of the three analytical approaches were higher in the case of rbcL compared to the 18S marker, highlighting the importance of the reference database which is more complete for the rbcL marker. Our study confirms the effectiveness of diatom metabarcoding as an operational tool for rivers ecological quality assessment and shows that the analytical approaches by-passing the taxonomic assignments are particularly efficient when reference databases are incomplete.},

abstract = {Opisthokonta represents a major lineage of eukaryotes and includes fungi and metazoans, as well as other less known unicellular groups. The latter are paraphyletic assemblages that branch in between the former two groups, and thus are important for understanding the origin and early diversification of opisthokonts. The full range of their diversity, however, has not yet been explored from diverse ecological habitats. Freshwater environments are crucial sources for new diversity; they are considered even more heterogeneous than marine ecosystems. This heterogeneity implies more ecological niches where local eukaryotic communities are located. However, knowledge of the unicellular opisthokont diversity is scarce from freshwater environments. Here, we performed an 18S rDNA metabarcoding study in the Middle Paran{\'{a}} River, Argentina, to characterize the molecular diversity of microbial eukaryotes, in particular unicellular members of Opisthokonta. We identified a potential novel clade branching as a sister-group to Fungi. We also detected in our data that more than 60{\%} operational taxonomic units classified as unicellular holozoans (animals and relatives) represent new taxa at the species level. Of the remaining, the majority was assigned to the newly described holozoan species, Syssomonas multiformis. Together, our results show that a large hidden diversity of unicellular members of opisthokonts still remain to be uncovered. We also found that the geographical and ecological distribution of several taxa considered exclusive to marine environments is wider than previously thought.},

abstract = {The heterotrophic labyrinthulomycete protists have long been known to play an important role in the nutrient cycling of coastal seawater. Yet, their spatiotemporal abundance and diversity in polluted coastal waters remain poorly discussed, due in part to the paucity of a rapid detection method. To this end, we developed a qPCR detection method based on a newly designed primer pair targeting their 18S rRNA gene. Using this method, we studied the population dynamics of labyrinthulomycete protists in nutrient-rich (Shenzhen Bay) and low-nutrient (Daya) coastal habitats along the Pearl River Delta. We found a significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher abundance of Labyrinthulomycetes in the Shenzhen bay (average 3455 gene copies mL −1 ) than that in Daya Bay (average 378 gene copies mL −1 ). Their abundance gradient positively correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with the levels of inorganic nitrogen and phosphates. Further characterization of the molecular diversity of these protists in Shenzhen Bay using different primer sets revealed the presence of several genera besides a large number of unclassified OTUs. Regardless of the primer biases, our results show significant (P {\textless} 0.05) spatiotemporal changes in the molecular abundance and diversity of these heterotrophic protists. Overall, this study provides a rapid molecular detection tool for Labyrinthulomycetes and expands our current understanding of their dynamics controlled by physicochemical gradients in coastal waters.},

abstract = {The importance of microbial eukaryotes to aquatic systems has been widely acknowledged in the last decade, and the application of high-throughput sequencing techniques has revealed an astonishing diversity and high proportions of novel taxa. Most studies have focused either on marine or freshwater ecosystems; thus, information on estuarine communities is either incomplete or missing. We assessed the composition of microbial eukaryotes along a South Australian coastal lagoon affected by a broad (7 to 65 PSU) salinity gradient, the Coorong Lagoon. This lagoon extends for over 170 km from the mouth of the River Murray (Murray Mouth) south- wards, where the salinity increases up to hypersaline values. We sampled 5 stations during the austral summer and winter and sequenced the amplified V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene using Ion Torrent. Genetic libraries were mostly represented by reads from 5 phyla, with Chlorophyta prevailing in summer, diatoms in winter and Haptophyta in the southernmost sampling sites. In spite of the broad spatial and temporal salinity changes observed, the communities of small eukaryotes clustered in 2 groups reflecting the sample location. Moreover, dissimilarities between samples were unaffected by differences in salinity, but increased with increasing geographic dis- tances. Microbial exchanges from the Coorong Lagoon towards both freshwater and seawater occur via the Murray Mouth and are likely to prevent the formation of communities adapted to local salinity conditions. However, such exchanges likely decrease with increasing distances from the Murray Mouth, resulting in distance-driven eukaryotic communities. KEY},

abstract = {Abstract. Long chain alkyl diols (LCDs) are widespread in the marine water column and sediments but their biological sources are mostly unknown. Here we combine lipid analyses with 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected in the photic zone of the tropical North Atlantic at 24 stations to infer relationships between LCDs and potential LCD-producers. The C30 1,15-diol was detected in all SPM samples and accounted for {\textgreater}95{\%} of the total LCDs, while minor proportions of C28 and C30 1,13-diols, C28 and C30 1,14-diols as well as C32 1,15-diol were found. The concentration of the C30 and C32 diols was higher in the mixed layer of the water column compared to the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), whereas concentrations of C28 diols were comparable. Sequencing analyses revealed extremely low contributions (≈0.1{\%} of the 18S rRNA gene reads) of known LCD-producers but the contributions from two taxonomic classes to which known producers are affiliated, i.e. Dictyochophyceae and Chrysophyceae, followed a trend similar to that of the concentrations of C30 and C32 diols. Statistical analyses indicated that the abundance of 4 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the Chrysophyceae and Dictyochophyceae, along with 23 OTUs falling in other phylogenetic groups, were significantly correlated with C30 diol concentrations. However, it is not clear whether some of these OTUs might indeed correspond to LCD-producers or whether these correlations are just indirect. Furthermore, based on the average LCD-content measured in cultivated LCD-producing algae, the detected concentrations of LCDs in SPM are too high to be explained by the abundances of the suspected LCD-producing OTUs. This is likely explained by the slower degradation of LCDs compared to DNA in the oxic water column and suggests that some of the LCDs found here were likely to be associated to suspended debris, while the DNA from the related LCD-producers had been already fully degraded. This suggests that care should be taken in constraining biological sources of relatively stable biomarker lipids by quantitative comparisons of DNA and lipid abundances.},

abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of marine sediments has revealed large amounts of sequences assigned to planktonic taxa. How this planktonic eDNA is delivered on the seafloor and preserved in the sediment is not well understood. We address these questions by comparing metabarcoding and microfossil foraminifera assemblages in sediment cores taken off Newfoundland across a strong ecological gradient. We detected planktonic foraminifera eDNA down to 30 cm and observed that the planktonic/benthic amplicon ratio changed with depth. The relative proportion of planktonic foraminiferal amplicons remained low from the surface down to 10 cm, likely due to the presence of DNA from living benthic foraminifera. Below 10 cm, the relative proportion of planktonic foraminifera amplicons rocketed, likely reflecting the higher proportion of planktonic eDNA in the DNA burial flux. In addition, the microfossil and metabarcoding assemblages showed a congruent pattern indicating that planktonic foraminifera eDNA is deposited without substantial lateral advection and preserves regional biogeographical patterns, indicating deposition by a similar mechanism as the foraminiferal shells. Our study shows that the planktonic eDNA preserved in marine sediments has the potential to record climatic and biotic changes in the pelagic community with the same spatial and temporal resolution as microfossils.},

We used barcoded pyrosequencing to survey comprehensively the diversity of soil protists from 40 sites across a broad geographic range that represent a variety of biome types, from tropical forests to deserts. In addition to taxa known to be dominant in soil, including Cercozoa and Ciliophora, we found high relative abundances of groups such as Apicomplexa and Dinophyceae that have not previously been recognized as being important components of soil microbial communities. Soil protistan communities were highly diverse, approaching the extreme diversity of their bacterial counterparts across the same sites. Like bacterial taxa, protistan taxa were not globally distributed, and the composition of these communities diverged considerably across large geographic distances. However, soil protistan and bacterial communities exhibit very different global-scale biogeographical patterns, with protistan communities strongly structured by climatic conditions that regulate annual soil moisture availability. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

The most represented genera were Micromonas and Mantoniella. For the first time, the predominance of Mantoniella (in four samples) and Bolidophyceae (in one sample) was observed in under-ice water.

abstract = {We examined the short-term variability, by daily to weekly sampling, of protist assemblages from March to July in surface water of the San Pedro Ocean Time-series station (eastern North Pacific), by V4 Illumina sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. The sampling period encompassed a spring bloom followed by progression to summer conditions. Several protistan taxa displayed sharp increases and declines, with whole community Bray–Curtis dissimilarities of adjacent days being 66{\%} in March and 40{\%} in May. High initial abundance of parasitic Cercozoa Cryothecomonas longipes and Protaspis grandis coincided with a precipitous decline of blooming Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms, possibly suggesting their massive infection by these parasites; these cercozoans were hardly detectable afterwards. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a limited predictability of community variability from environmental factors. This indicates that other factors are relevant in explaining changes in protist community composition at short temporal scales, such as interspecific relationships, stochastic processes, mixing with adjacent water, or advection of patches with different protist communities. Association network analysis revealed that interactions between the many parasitic OTUs and other taxa were overwhelmingly positive and suggest that although sometimes parasites may cause a crash of host populations, they may often follow their hosts and do not regularly cause enough mortality to potentially create negative correlations at the daily to weekly time scales we studied.},

We used 454 pyrosequencing on large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) fragments to assess the diversity from size-fractioned plankton samples collected in the Bay of Naples. One group-specific primer set targeting the LSU rDNA D1/D2 region was designed to amplify Haptophyte sequences from nucleic acid extracts (total DNA or RNA) of two size fractions (0.8-3 or 3-20 $\mu$m) and two sampling depths [subsurface, at 1 m, or deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) at 23 m]. 454 reads were identified using a database covering the entire Haptophyta diversity currently sequenced. Our data set revealed several hundreds of Haptophyte clusters. However, most of these clusters could not be linked to taxonomically known sequences: considering OTUs97{\%} (clusters build at a sequence identity level of 97{\%}) on our global data set, less than 1{\%} of the reads clustered with sequences from cultures, and less than 12{\%} clustered with reference sequences obtained previously from cloning and Sanger sequencing of environmental samples. Thus, we highlighted a large uncharacterized environmental genetic diversity, which clearly shows that currently cultivated species poorly reflect the actual diversity present in the natural environment. Haptophyte community appeared to be significantly structured according to the depth. The highest diversity and evenness were obtained in samples from the DCM, and samples from the large size fraction (3-20 $\mu$m) taken at the DCM shared a lower proportion of common OTUs97{\%} with the other samples. Reads from the species Chrysoculter romboideus were notably found at the DCM, while they could be detected at the subsurface. The highest proportion of totally unknown OTUs97{\%} was collected at the DCM in the smallest size fraction (0.8-3 $\mu$m).

abstract = {Protists influence ecosystems by modulating microbial population size, diversity, metabolic outputs and gene flow. In this study we used eukaryotic ribosomal amplicon diversity from 218 European freshwater lakes sampled in August 2012 to assess the effect of mountain ranges as biogeographic barriers on spatial patterns and microbial community structure in European freshwaters. The diversity of microbial communities as reflected by amplicon clusters suggested that the eukaryotic microbial inventory of lakes was well-sampled at the European and at the local scale. Our pan-European diversity analysis indicated that biodiversity and richness of high mountain lakes differed from that of lowland lakes. Further, the taxon inventory of high-mountain lakes strongly contributed to beta-diversity despite a low taxon inventory. Even though ecological factors, in general, strongly affect protist community pattern, we show that geographic distance and geographic barriers significantly contribute to community composition particularly for high mountain regions which presumably act as biogeographic islands. However, community composition in lowland lakes was also affected by geographic distance but less pronounced as in high mountain regions. In consequence protist populations are locally structured into distinct biogeographic provinces and community analyses revealed biogeographic patterns also for lowland lakes whereby European mountain ranges act as dispersal barriers in particular for short to intermediate distances whereas the effect of mountain ranges levels off on larger scale.},

abstract = {The North Atlantic phytoplankton spring bloom is the pinnacle in an annual cycle that is driven by physical, chemical, and biological seasonality. Despite its important contributions to the global carbon cycle, transitions in plankton community composition between the winter and spring have been scarcely examined in the North Atlantic. Phytoplankton composition in early winter was compared with latitudinal transects that captured the subsequent spring bloom climax. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), imaging flow cytometry, and flow-cytometry provided a synoptic view of phytoplankton diversity. Phytoplankton communities were not uniform across the sites studied, but rather mapped with apparent fidelity onto subpolar- and subtropical-influenced water masses of the North Atlantic. At most stations, cells {\textless} 20-µm diameter were the main contributors to phytoplankton biomass. Winter phytoplankton communities were dominated by cyanobacteria and pico-phytoeukaryotes. These transitioned to more diverse and dynamic spring communities in which pico- and nano-phytoeukaryotes, including many prasinophyte algae, dominated. Diatoms, which are often assumed to be the dominant phytoplankton in blooms, were contributors but not the major component of biomass. We show that diverse, small phytoplankton taxa are unexpectedly common in the western North Atlantic and that regional influences play a large role in modulating community transitions during the seasonal progression of blooms.},

abstract = {The East China Sea (ECS) has long been considered an important monitoring site for oceanic ecosystem changes because many water currents and river discharges constantly influence this area. In this study, the community structure and diversity of phytoplankton in the northern part of the ECS adjacent to Jeju Island were explored using small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU) pyrosequencing. We analysed samples collected from four stations from the surface and at 30-m and 50-m depths during April and September 2011. We observed spatial and temporal variations in the phytoplankton community. Among phytoplankton, diatoms and dinoflagellates constituted a major portion at all stations (60–90{\%}). However, comparison of the April and September samples showed seasonal variation and shifts in the dispersion of diatom and dinoflagellates among stations. Among stations, diatoms dominated St. 1 and others were dominated by dinoflagellates. Furthermore, phylotypes of potentially toxin-producing genera such as Karlodinium, Heterocapsa, Gymnodinium, Gyrodinium, and Pseudo-nitzschia were dominant in this area.},

abstract = {1. The abyssal seafloor covers more than 50{\%} of planet Earth and is a large reservoir of still mostly undescribed biodiversity. It is increasingly under target of resource-extraction industries although being drastically understudied. In such remote and hard-to-access ecosystems, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a useful and efficient tool for studying biodiversity and implementing environmental impact assessments. Yet, eDNA analysis outcomes may be biased towards describing past rather than present communities as sediments contain both contemporary and ancient DNA. 2. Using commercially available kits, we investigated the impacts of five molecular processing methods on DNA metabarcoding biodiversity inventories targeting prokaryotes (16S-V4V5), unicellular eukaryotes (18S-V4), and metazoans (18S-V1, COI). As the size distribution of ancient DNA is skewed towards small fragments, we evaluated the effect of removing short DNA fragments via size-selection and ethanol reconcentration using DNA extracted from 10 g of sediment at five deep-sea sites. We also compare communities revealed by DNA and RNA co-extracted from 2 g of sediment at the same sites. 3. Results show that removing short DNA fragments does not affect alpha and beta diversity estimates in any of the biological compartments investigated. Results also confirm doubts regarding the possibility to better describe live communities using environmental RNA (eRNA). With ribosomal loci, RNA, while resolving similar spatial patterns than co-extracted DNA, resulted in significantly higher richness estimates, supporting hypotheses of increased persistence of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the environment and unmeasured bias due to over-abundance of rRNA and RNA release. With the mitochondrial locus, RNA detected lower metazoan richness and resolved less spatial patterns than co-extracted DNA, reflecting high messenger RNA lability. Results also highlight the importance of using large amounts of sediment (≥10 g) for accurately surveying eukaryotic diversity. 4. We conclude that DNA should be favoured over RNA for logistically realistic, repeatable, and reliable surveys, and confirm that large sediment samples (≥10 g) deliver more complete and accurate assessments of benthic eukaryotic biodiversity and that increasing the number of biological rather than technical replicates is important to infer robust ecological patterns.},

abstract = {Studies based on the coupling of a paleolimnological approach and molecular tools (e.g., sequencing of sedimentary DNA) present a promising opportunity to obtain long-term data on past lacustrine biodiversity. However, certain validations are still required, such as the evaluation of DNA preservation in sediments for various planktonic taxa that do not leave any morphological diagnostic features. In this study, we focused on the diversity of planktonic unicellular eukaryotes and verified the presence of their DNA in sediment archives. We compared the molecular inventories (high-throughput sequencing of 18S ribosomal DNA) obtained from monitoring the water column with those obtained for DNA archived in the first 30 cm of sediment. Seventy-one percent of taxonomic units found in the water samples were detected in sediment samples, including pigmented taxa, such as Chlorophyta, Dinophyceae, and Chrysophyceae, phagotrophic taxa, such as Ciliophora, parasitic taxa, such as Apicomplexa and Chytridiomycota, and saprotrophs, such as Cryptomycota. Parallel analysis of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcripts revealed the presence of living eukaryotic taxa only in the top 2 cm of sediment; although some limits exist in using RNA/DNA ratio as indicator of microbial activity, these results suggested that the sedimentary DNA mostly represented DNA from past and inactive communities. Only the diversity of a few groups, such as Cryptophyta and Haptophyta, seemed to be poorly preserved in sediments. Our overall results showed that the application of sequencing techniques to sedimentary DNA could be used to reconstruct past diversity for numerous planktonic eukaryotic groups.},

abstract = {Assessing the extent to which changes in lacustrine biodiversity are affected by anthropogenic or climatic forces requires extensive palaeolimnological data. We used high-throughput sequencing to generate time-series data encompassing over 2200 years of microbial eukaryotes (protists and Fungi) diversity changes from the sedimentary DNA record of two lakes (Lake Bourget in French Alps and Lake Igaliku in Greenland). From 176 samples, we sequenced a large diversity of microbial eukaryotes, with a total 16 386 operational taxonomic units distributed within 50 phylogenetic groups. Thus, microbial groups, such as Chlorophyta, Dinophyceae, Haptophyceae and Ciliophora, that were not previously considered in lacustrine sediment record analyses appeared to be potential biological markers of trophic status changes. Our data suggest that shifts in relative abundance of extant species, including shifts between rare and abundant taxa, drive ecosystem responses to local and global environmental changes. Community structure shift events were concomitant with major climate variations (more particularly in Lake Igaliku). However, this study shows that the impacts of climatic fluctuations may be overpassed by the high-magnitude eutrophication impacts, as observed in the eutrophicated Lake Bourget. Overall, our data show that DNA preserved in sediment constitutes a precious archive of information on past biodiversity changes},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of sedimentary DNA (sed-DNA) was utilized to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of microbial eukaryotic communities (MECs) at a centennial scale in two re-oligotrophicated lakes that were exposed to different levels of phosphorus enrichment. The temporal changes within the MECs were expressed in terms of richness, composition and community structure to investigate their relationships with two key forcing factors (i.e., nutrient enrichment and climate warming). Various groups, including Apicomplexa, Cercozoa, Chrysophyceae, Ciliophora, Chlorophyceae and Dinophyceae, responded to phosphorus enrichment levels with either positive or negative impacts on their richness and relative abundance. For both lakes, statistical modelling demonstrated that phosphorus concentration ([P]) was a dominant contributor to MECs modifications before the 1980s; after the mid-80s, the contribution of air temperature changes increased and potentially surpassed the contribution of [P]. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that some clusters of taxa (i.e., modules) composed mainly of Dinophyceae and unclassified Alveolata were strongly correlated to air temperature in both lakes. Overall, our data showed that sed-DNA constitutes a precious archive of information on past biodiversity changes, allowing the study of the dynamics of numerous eukaryotic groups that were not traditionally considered in paleo-reconstructions.},

abstract = {Much is known about how broad eukaryotic phytoplankton groups vary according to nutrient availability in marine ecosystems. However, genus- and species-level dynamics are generally unknown, although important given that adaptation and acclimation processes differentiate at these levels. We examined phytoplankton communities across seasonal cycles in the North Atlantic (BATS) and under different trophic conditions in the eastern North Pacific (ENP), using phylogenetic classification of plastid-encoded 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and other methodologies, including flow cytometric cell sorting. Prasinophytes dominated eukaryotic phytoplankton amplicons during the nutrient-rich deep-mixing winter period at BATS. During stratification (‘summer') uncultured dictyochophytes formed ∼35 ± 10{\%} of all surface plastid amplicons and dominated those from stramenopile algae, whereas diatoms showed only minor, ephemeral contributions over the entire year. Uncultured dictyochophytes also comprised a major fraction of plastid amplicons in the oligotrophic ENP. Phylogenetic reconstructions of near-full length 16S rRNA sequences established 11 uncultured Dictyochophyte Environmental Clades (DEC). DEC-I and DEC-VI dominated surface dictyochophytes under stratification at BATS and in the ENP, and DEC-IV was also important in the latter. Additionally, although less common at BATS, Florenciella-related clades (FC) were prominent at depth in the ENP. In both ecosystems, pelagophytes contributed notably at depth, with PEC-VIII (Pelagophyte Environmental Clade) and (cultured) Pelagomonas calceolata being most important. Q-PCR confirmed the near absence of P. calceolata at the surface of the same oligotrophic sites where it reached ∼1,500 18S rRNA gene copies ml–1 at the DCM. To further characterize phytoplankton present in our samples, we performed staining and at-sea single-cell sorting experiments. Sequencing results from these indicated several uncultured dictyochophyte clades are comprised of predatory mixotrophs. From an evolutionary perspective, these cells showed both conserved and unique features in the chloroplast genome. In ENP metatranscriptomes we observed high expression of multiple chloroplast genes as well as expression of a selfish element (group II intron) in the psaA gene. Comparative analyses across the Pacific and Atlantic sites support the conclusion that predatory dictyochophytes thrive under low nutrient conditions. The observations that several uncultured dictyochophyte lineages are seemingly capable of photosynthesis and predation, raises questions about potential shifts in phytoplankton trophic roles associated with seasonality and long-term ocean change.},

Here, we investigated the eukaryotic community in a pond (salinity of 2-4) on Dokdo (island) in the East Sea, Korea, using Illumina sequencing with primer sets for the V4 and V9 regions of 18S rDNA from 2016 to 2018 for the first time. Totally, 1,413 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 915 OTUs were detected using the V9 and V4 primer sets, respectively. Taxonomic analyses of these OTUs revealed that although the V4 primer set failed to describe the extant diversity for some major sub-division groups, the V9 primer set represented their diversity. Moreover, the rare taxa with {\textless}1{\%} of total reads were exclusively detected using V9 primer set. Hence, the diversity of the eukaryotic community can vary depending on the choice of primers. The Illumina sequencing data of the V9 region of 18S rDNA may be advantageous for estimating the richness of the eukaryotic community including a rare biosphere, whereas the simultaneous application of two biomarkers may be suitable for understanding the molecular phylogenetic relationships. We strongly recommend both biomarkers be used to assess the diversity and phylogenetic relationship within the eukaryotic community in natural samples.},

abstract = {Parasites are not typically considered to be important components of polar marine ecosystems. It was therefore sur-prising when 18S rDNA surveys of protists in the West Antarctic Peninsula in winter revealed high abundances of parasite sequences. Parasite sequences made up, on average, over half (52{\%}) of sequence reads in samples from deep water in winter. Winter surface water and sediment samples contained relatively fewer, but still strikingly high, parasite sequence reads (13 and 9{\%}, respectively), while surface water samples in summer contained fewer parasite sequences (1.8{\%}). A total of 1028 distinct parasite Operational Taxonomic Units were observed in winter, with the largest abun-dances and diversities within Syndiniales groups I and II, including Amoebophrya. Less abundant parasite sequence groups included Apicomplexa, Blastodinium, Chytriodinium, Cryptocaryon, Paradinium, Perkinsidae, Pirsonia and Ichthyophonae. Parasite sequence distributions suggested interactions with known hosts, such as diatom parasites which were mainly in the sedi-ments, where resting spores of Chaetoceros spp. diatoms were abundant. Syndiniales sequences were correlated with radio-larian sequences, suggesting parasite–host interactions. The abundant proportions of parasite sequences indicate a potentially important role for parasites in the Antarctic marine ecosystem, with implications for plankton population dy-namics, the role of the microbial loop, carbon flows and ecosystem responses to ongoing anthropogenic climate change. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has traditionally been thought of as a comparatively simple ecosystem, with the food web dominated by relatively few types of organisms and interactions; large phytoplankton being consumed by krill, which were in turn consumed by penguins, seals available online at www.plankt.oxfordjournals.org},

Four morphologically cryptic species, the primarily arctic Pseudocalanus minutus and Pseudocalanus acuspes, and the more temperate Pseudocalanus newmani and Pseudocalanus mimus, are found within the Bering Sea. Pseudocalanus are generally considered phytoplanktivores. However, their feeding is poorly known, despite their importance to the ecosystem. In situ feeding by the three most abundant Pseudocalanus congeners, P. minutus, P. newmani, and P. acuspes, was investigated by sequencing partial 18S rDNA (ribosomal Deoxyribonucleic Acid) of gut contents from 225 individuals sampled from 8 stations across the Bering Sea in May and June of 2010. The 28,456 prey 18S rDNA sequences obtained clustered into 138 distinct prey items with a 97{\%} similarity cutoff , and included diatoms, dinoflagellates, microzooplank-ton, mesozooplankton, and vascular plants. Pseudocalanus diets reflected variations in the environment, with phytoplankton sequences relatively more abundant in copepods from stations with higher water-column chlorophyll a concentrations. Feeding differences were observed between species. P. acuspes diet contained relatively more heterotrophic dinoflagellate sequences, and was significantly different from that of P. minutus and P. newmani, both of which contained relatively more diatom sequences, and between which no significant difference was observed. Feeding differences between the two primarily arctic species may be a mechanism of niche partitioning between these spatially co-located congeners and may have implications for the effects of climate change on the success of these abundant zooplankters and their many predators in this ecosystem.},

abstract = {For photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes, the rate-limiting step in NO 3 - assimilation is its reduction to nitrite (NO 2 - ), which is catalyzed by assimilatory NO 3 - reductase (NR). Oceanic productivity is primarily limited by available nitrogen and, although nitrate is the most abundant form of available nitrogen in oceanic waters, little is known about the identity of microbial eukaryotes that take up nitrate. This lack of knowledge is especially severe in ice covered seas that are being profoundly affected by climate change. To address this, we examined the distribution and diversity of NR genes in the Arctic by way of clone libraries and data mining available metagenomes (total of 4.24 billion reads). We directly compared NR clone phylogenies with the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene (DNA pool) and 18S rRNA (RNA pool) at two ice-influenced stations in the Canada Basin (Beaufort Sea). The communities from the two nucleic acid templates were similar at the level of major groups, and species identified by way of NR gene phylogeny and microscopy were a subset of the 18S results. Most NR genes from Arctic clone libraries matched diatoms and chromist nanoflagellates, including novel clades, while the NR genes in Arctic eukaryote metagenomes were dominated by chlorophyte NR, in keeping with the ubiquitous occurrence of Mamiellophyceae in the Arctic Ocean. Overall, these data suggest that a dynamic and mixed eukaryotic community utilizes nitrate across the Arctic and show the potential utility of NR as a tool to identify ongoing changes in arctic photosynthetic communities.},

abstract = {Increasing global temperatures are having a profound impact in the Arctic, including the dramatic loss of multiyear sea ice in 2007 that has continued to the present. The majority of life in the Arctic is microbial and the consequences of climate-mediated changes on microbial marine food webs, which are responsible for biogeochemical cycling and support higher trophic levels, are unknown. We examined microbial communities over time by using high-throughput sequencing of microbial DNA collected between 2003 and 2010 from the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer of the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic). We found that overall this layer has freshened and concentrations of nitrate, the limiting nutrient for photosynthetic production in Arctic seas, have decreased. We compared microbial communities from before and after the record September 2007 sea ice minimum and detected significant differences in communities from all three domains of life. In particular, there were significant changes in species composition of Eukarya, with ciliates becoming more common and heterotrophic marine stramenopiles (MASTs) accounting for a smaller proportion of sequences retrieved after 2007. Within the Archaea, Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota, which earlier represented up to 60{\%} of the Archaea sequences in this layer, have declined to {\textless}10{\%}. Bacterial communities overall were less diverse after 2007, with a significant decrease of the Bacteroidetes. These significant shifts suggest that the microbial food webs are sensitive to physical oceanographic changes such as those occurring in the Canadian Arctic over the past decade.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers convey freshwater from lands to the oceans, transporting various organic particles, minerals, and living organisms. Microbial communities are key components of freshwater food webs and take up, utilize, and transform this material. However, there are still important gaps in our understanding of the dynamic of these organisms along the river channels. Using high-throughput 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR on a 11-km long transect of the Saint-Charles River (Quebec, CA), starting from its main source, the Saint-Charles Lake, we show that bacterial and protist community structures in the river drifted quickly but progressively downstream of its source. The dominant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) of the lake, notably related to Cyanobacteria, decreased in proportions, whereas relative proportions of other OTUs, such as a Pseudarcicella OTU, increased along the river course, becoming quickly predominant in the river system. Both prokaryotic and protist communities changed along the river transect, suggesting a strong impact of the shift from a stratified lake ecosystem to a continuously mixed river environment. This might reflect the cumulative effects of the increasing water turbulence, fluctuations of physicochemical conditions, differential predation pressure in the river, especially in the lake outlet by benthic filter feeders, or the relocation of microorganisms, through flocculation, sedimentation, resuspension, or inoculation from the watershed. Our study reveals that the transit of water in a river system can greatly impact both bacterial and micro-eukaryotic community composition, even over a short distance, and, potentially, the transformation of materials in the water column.},

However, their diversity, ecology and structuring factors shaping their temporal distribution remain strongly misunderstood in freshwaters. Using high-throughput sequencing on water samples collected over 16 different months (including two summer and two winter periods), combined with geochemical measurements and climate monitoring, we comprehensively determined the pico- and nanoeukaryotic community composition and dynamics in a Canadian river undergoing prolonged ice-cover winters. Our analysis revealed a large protist diversity in this fluctuating ecosystem and clear seasonal patterns demonstrating a direct and/or indirect selective role of abiotic factors, such as water temperature or nitrogen concentrations, in structuring the eukaryotic microbial community. Nonetheless, our results also revealed that primary productivity, predatory as well as parasitism lifestyles, inferred from fine phylogenetic placements, remained potentially present over the annual cycle, despite the large seasonal fluctuations and the remodeling of the community composition under ice. In addition, potential interplays with the bacterial community composition were identified supporting a possible contribution of the bacterial community to the temporal dynamics of the protist community structure. Our results illustrate the complexity of the eukaryotic microbial community and provide a substantive and useful dataset to better understand the global freshwater ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals host assemblages of symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.) whose diversity and abundance may fluctuate under different conditions, potentially facilitating acclimatization to environmental change. The composition of free-living Symbiodinium in reef waters and sediments may also be environmentally labile and may influence symbiotic assemblages by mediating supply and dispersal. The magnitude and spatial scales of environmental influence over Symbiodinium composition in different reef habitat compartments are, however, not well understood. We used pyrosequencing to compare Symbiodinium in sediments, water, and ten coral species between two backreef pools in American Samoa with contrasting thermal environments. We found distinct compartmental assemblages of clades A, C, D, F, and/or G Symbiodinium types, with strong differences between pools in water, sediments, and two coral species. In the pool with higher and more variable temperatures, abundance of various clade A and C types differed compared to the other pool, while abundance of D types was lower in sediments but higher in water and in Pavona venosa, revealing an altered habitat distribution and potential linkages among compartments. The lack of between-pool effects in other coral species was due to either low overall variability (in the case of Porites) or high within-pool variability. Symbiodinium communities in water and sediment also showed within-pool structure, indicating that environmental influences may operate over multiple, small spatial scales. This work suggests that Symbiodinium composition is highly labile in reef waters, sediments, and some corals, but the underlying drivers and functional consequences of this plasticity require further testing with high spatial resolution biological and environmental sampling.},

abstract = {The study region in Sagres, SW Portugal, is subject to natural eutrophication of coastal waters by wind-driven upwelling, which stimulates high primary productivity facilitating the recent economic expansion of bivalve aquaculture in the region. However, this economic activity is threatened by harmful algal blooms (HAB) caused by the diatoms Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Dinophysis spp. and other HAB dinoflagellates, all of which can produce toxins, that can induce Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP), Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) and Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). This study couples traditional microscopy with 18S/28S rRNA microarray to improve the detection of HAB species and investigates the relation between HAB and the specific oceanographic conditions in the region. Good agreement was obtained between microscopy and microarray data for diatoms of genus Pseudo-nitzschia and dinoflagellates Dinophysis spp., Gymnodinium catenatum and raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo, with less effective results for Prorocentrum. Microarray provided detection of flagellates Prymnesium spp., Pseudochattonella spp., Chloromorum toxicum and the important HAB dinoflagellates of the genera Alexandrium and Azadinium, with the latter being one of the first records from the study region. Seasonality and upwelling induced by northerly winds were found to be the driving forces of HAB development, with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. causing the risk of ASP during spring and summer upwelling season, and dinoflagellates causing the risk of DSP and PSP during upwelling relaxation, mainly in summer and autumn. The findings were in agreement with the results from toxicity monitoring of shellfish by the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere and confirm the suitability of the RNA microarray method for HABs detection and aquaculture management applications.},

abstract = {Identifying which abiotic and biotic factors determine microbial community assembly is crucial to understand ecological processes and predict how communities will respond to environmental change. While global surveys aim at addressing this question in the world's oceans, equivalent studies in large freshwater systems are virtually lacking. Being the oldest, deepest and most voluminous freshwater lake on Earth, Lake Baikal offers a unique opportunity to test the effect of horizontal versus vertical gradients in community structure. Here, we characterized the structure of planktonic microbial eukaryotic communities (0.2-30 µm cell size) along a North-South latitudinal gradient (∼600 km) from samples collected in coastal and pelagic waters and from surface to the deepest zones (5-1400 m) using an 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach. Our results show complex and diverse protist communities dominated by alveolates (ciliates and dinoflagellates), ochrophytes and holomycotan lineages, with cryptophytes, haptophytes, katablepharids and telonemids in moderate abundance and many low-frequency lineages, including several typical marine members, such as diplonemids, syndinians and radiolarians. Depth had a strong significant effect on protist community stratification. By contrast, the effect of the latitudinal gradient was marginal and no significant difference was observed between coastal and surface open water communities. Co-occurrence network analyses showed that epipelagic communities are much more interconnected than meso- and bathypelagic communities and suggest specific biotic interactions between autotrophic, heterotrophic and parasitic lineages that influence protist community structure. Since climate change is rapidly affecting Siberia and Lake Baikal, our comprehensive protist survey constitutes a useful reference to monitor ongoing community shifts. Originality and Significance Statement Lake Baikal is the oldest, deepest and most voluminous freshwater lake on Earth, offering a unique opportunity to test the effects of horizontal versus vertical gradients on microbial community structure. Using a metabarcoding approach, we studied planktonic microbial eukaryotes from Baikal water columns (5 up to 1,400 m depth) across a North-South latitudinal gradient (∼600 km), including coastal and pelagic areas. Our results show that depth has a strong effect on protist community assemblage, but not latitude (minor effect) or coastal vs. open water sites (no effect). Co-occurrence analyses also point to specific biotic interactions as drivers of community structure. This comprehensive survey constitutes a useful reference for monitoring active climate change effects in this ancient lake. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, the impact of macrofauna on the community structure of microorganisms is poorly understood. Here, we show that microbial communities across bioturbated, but geochemically and sedimentologically divergent, continental margin sites are highly similar but differ clearly from those in nonbioturbated surface and underlying subsurface sediments. Solid- and solute-phase geochemical analyses combined with modeled bioturbation activities reveal that dissolved O2 introduction by burrow ventilation is the major driver of archaeal community structure. By contrast, solid-phase reworking, which regulates the distribution of fresh, algal organic matter, is the main control of bacterial community structure. In nonbioturbated surface sediments and in subsurface sediments, bacterial and archaeal communities are more divergent between locations and appear mainly driven by site-specific differences in organic carbon sources.},

The characterisation of environmental DNA (eDNA) from sediment and seawater using metabarcoding offers a powerful molecular lens to observe marine biota and provides a series of ‘snapshots' across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms. Using these next-generation tools and downstream analytical innovations including machine learning sequence assignment algorithms and co-occurrence network analyses, we examined how anthropogenic pressures may have impacted marine biodiversity on subtropical coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan. Based on 18 S ribosomal RNA, but not ITS2 sequence data due to inconsistent amplification for this marker, as well as proxies for anthropogenic disturbance, we show that eukaryotic richness at the family level significantly increases with medium and high levels of disturbance. This change in richness coincides with compositional changes, a decrease in connectedness among taxa, an increase in fragmentation of taxon co-occurrence networks, and a shift in indicator taxa. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the ability of eDNA to act as a barometer of disturbance and provide an exemplar of how biotic networks and coral reefs may be impacted by anthropogenic activities.},

abstract = {Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) caused by water column stratification appear to expand in parts of the world's ocean, with consequences for marine biogeochemical cycles. OMZ formation is often fueled by high surface primary production, and sinking organic particles can be hotspots of interactions and activity within microbial communities. This study investigated the diversity of OMZ protist communities in two biomass size fractions ({\textgreater}30 and 30-1.6 $\mu$m filters) from the world's largest permanent OMZ in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of V4 region of 18S SSU rRNA genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with vs. anoxic waters shared only ∼32{\%} of OTU (97{\%} sequence identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7{\%} of total OTUs were recovered at both stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6-30$\mu$m fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the surface-originated sinking particles.},

abstract = {Microalgae in the division Haptophyta play key roles in the marine ecosystem and in global biogeochemical processes. Despite their ecological importance, knowledge on seasonal dynamics, community composition and abundance at the species level is limited due to their small cell size and few morphological features visible under the light microscope. Here, we present unique data on haptophyte seasonal diversity and dynamics from two annual cycles, with the taxonomic resolution and sampling depth obtained with high-throughput sequencing. From outer Oslofjorden, S Norway, nano- and picoplanktonic samples were collected monthly for 2 years, and the haptophytes targeted by amplification of RNA/cDNA with Haptophyta-specific 18S rDNA V4 primers. We obtained 156 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), from c. 400.000 454 pyrosequencing reads, after rigorous bioinformatic filtering and clustering at 99.5{\%}. Most OTUs represented uncultured and/or not yet 18S rDNA-sequenced species. Haptophyte OTU richness and community composition exhibited high temporal variation and significant yearly periodicity. Richness was highest in September-October (autumn) and lowest in April-May (spring). Some taxa were detected all year, such as Chrysochromulina simplex, Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis cordata, whereas most calcifying coccolithophores only appeared from summer to early winter. We also revealed the seasonal dynamics of OTUs representing putative novel classes (clades HAP-3-5) or orders (clades D, E, F). Season, light and temperature accounted for 29{\%} of the variation in OTU composition. Residual variation may be related to biotic factors, such as competition and viral infection. This study provides new, in-depth knowledge on seasonal diversity and dynamics of haptophytes in North Atlantic coastal waters.},

abstract = {Arctic regions have experienced pronounced biological and biophysical transformations as a result of global change processes over the last several decades. Current hypotheses propose an elevated impact of those environmental changes on the biodiversity, community composition and metabolic processes of species. The effects on ecosystem function and services, particularly when invasive or toxigenic harmful species become dominant, can be expressed over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in plankton communities. Our study focused on the comparison of molecular biodiversity of three size-fractions (micro-, nano-, picoplankton) in the coastal pelagic zone of West Greenland and their association with environmental parameters. Molecular diversity was assessed via parallel amplicon sequencing the 28S rRNA hypervariable D1/D2 region. We showed that biodiversity distribution within the area of Uummannaq Fjord, Vaigat Strait and Disko Bay differed markedly within and among size-fractions. In general, we observed a higher diversity within the picoplankton size fraction compared to the nano- and microplankton. In multidimensional scaling analysis, community composition of all three size fractions correlated with cell size, silicate and phosphate, chlorophyll a (chl a) and dinophysistoxin (DTX). Individually, each size fraction community composition also correlated with other different environmental parameters, i.e. temperature and nitrate. We observed a more homogeneous community of the picoplankton across all stations compared to the larger size classes, despite different prevailing environmental conditions of the sampling areas. This suggests that habitat niche occupation for larger-celled species may lead to higher functional trait plasticity expressed as an enhanced range of phenotypes, whereas smaller organisms may compensate for lower potential plasticity with higher diversity. The presence of recently identified toxigenic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (such as Alexandrium fundyense and A. ostenfeldii) in the area points out the potential risk for this vulnerable ecosystem in a changing world.},

abstract = {The phytoplankton biomass in the Baltic Sea is low during the cold-water season (October to May) compared to the warm-water season (June to September). However, the sea ice is a habitat for diverse assemblages in polar and subpolar areas. These areas, including the Baltic Sea, are subject to changing environmental conditions due to global warming, and temporal and spatial studies are required to understand changes in the processes the organisms are involved in. We delineated microalgal succession in the northern Baltic Sea during the cold-water season using a weekly collected data set. Microscopy results together with molecular methods showed that 5 microbial groups could be distinguished: the sea-ice microalgal assemblage and 4 phytoplankton assemblages (fall, winter, under-ice water and spring). Based on cell enumeration, the microalgal biomass in the water column remained low until the end of the ice-covered season and was dominated by small flagellates and dinoflagellates. The young-ice assemblage in January resembled the water-column assemblage, but indicated a partly selective species-concentrating mechanism during ice formation due to lower species richness in ice than in the water column. Biomass of microalgae increased in the ice and water column during the March to May period, and the assemblage changed from flagellate-dominated to diatom- and dinoflagellate-dominated. The result that the spring phytoplankton, based on species and biomass, formed a separate as - semblage indicates that sea-ice algae did not contribute to the spring bloom phytoplankton assemblage.},

abstract = {Climate models project that the Arctic Ocean may experience ice-free summers by the second half of this century. This may have severe repercussions on phytoplankton bloom dynamics and the associated cycling of carbon in surface waters. We currently lack baseline knowledge of the seasonal dynamics of Arctic microbial communities, which is needed in order to better estimate the effects of such changes on ecosystem functioning. Here we present a comparative study of polar summer microbial communities in the ice-free (eastern) and ice-covered (western) hydrographic regimes at the LTER HAUSGARTEN in Fram Strait, the main gateway between the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Based on measured and modeled biogeochemical parameters, we tentatively identified two different ecosystem states (i.e., different phytoplankton bloom stages) in the distinct regions. Using Illumina tag-sequencing, we determined the community composition of both free-living and particle-associated bacteria as well as microbial eukaryotes in the photic layer. Despite substantial horizontal mixing by eddies in Fram Strait, pelagic microbial communities showed distinct differences between the two regimes, with a proposed early spring (pre-bloom) community in the ice-covered western regime (with higher representation of SAR11, SAR202, SAR406 and eukaryotic MALVs) and a community indicative of late summer conditions (post-bloom) in the ice-free eastern regime (with higher representation of Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and eukaryotic heterotrophs). Co-occurrence networks revealed specific taxon-taxon associations between bacterial and eukaryotic taxa in the two regions. Our results suggest that the predicted changes in sea ice cover and phytoplankton bloom dynamics will have a strong impact on bacterial community dynamics and potentially on biogeochemical cycles in this region.},

We have investigated the diversity of ciliates in freshwater and brackish environments along the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, based on the hypervariable V4 region of the 18S-rDNA obtained by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our analyses detected 409 ciliate taxonomic units (OTUs), mostly attributed to the classes Oligohymenophorea and Spirotrichea. A total of 11 classes, 12 subclasses, 112 genera, and 144 species were reported. We found the following: (a) the ciliate communities are more diverse in freshwater- than in Atlantic Forest-associated brackish environments; (b) the ciliate communities are composed by a small amount of highly abundant OTUs, but a high number of low-abundant or rare OTUs; (c) nearly one-third of the ciliate OTUs share less than 97{\%} sequence identity to reference sequences and (d) phylogenetic inference supports the hypothesis that the V4 region of the Ciliophora 18S-rDNA is a suitable marker for accurate evolutionary inferences at class level. Our results showed that a considerable fraction of the HTS-detected diversity of ciliates from Brazilian Atlantic Forest is not represented in the currently available molecular databases.},

Using metabarcoding of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes, we explored whether alphadiversity indices, abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units and taxonomic groups (and their ratios) provide information on the ecological quality of coastal waters. Our results revealed that only eukaryotic diversity metrics and a limited number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa displayed potential in assessing continental influences in our surveyed area, resulting thus in a restrained potential of microbial plankton diversity as an ecological indicator.

abstract = {We used high-throughput sequencing to unravel the genetic diversity of protistan (including fungal) plankton in hypersaline ponds of the Ria Formosa solar saltern works in Portugal. From three ponds of different salinity (4, 12 and 38 {\%}), we obtained ca. 105,000 amplicons (V4 region of the SSU rDNA). The genetic diversity we found was higher than what has been described from solar saltern ponds thus far by microscopy or molecular studies. The obtained operational taxonomic units (OTUs) could be assigned to 14 high-rank taxonomic groups and blasted to 120 eukaryotic families. The novelty of this genetic diversity was extremely high, with 27 {\%} of all OTUs having a sequence divergence of more than 10 {\%} to deposited sequences of described taxa. The highest degree of novelty was found at intermediate salinity of 12 {\%} within the ciliates, which traditionally are considered as the best known and described taxon group within the kingdom Protista. Further substantial novelty was detected within the stramenopiles and the chlorophytes. Analyses of community structures suggest a transition boundary for protistan plankton between 4 and 12 {\%} salinity, suggesting different haloadaptation strategies in individual evolutionary lineages as a result of environmental filtering. Our study makes evident the gaps in our knowledge not only of protistan and fungal plankton diversity in hypersaline environments, but also in their ecology and their strategies to cope with these environmental conditions. It substantiates that specific future research needs to fill these gaps.},

abstract = {Microbial eukaryotes hold a key role in aquatic ecosystem functioning. Yet, their diversity in freshwater lakes, particularly in high-mountain lakes, is relatively unknown compared with the marine environment. Low nutrient availability, low water temperature and high ultraviolet radiation make most high-mountain lakes extremely challenging habitats for life and require specific molecular and physiological adaptations. We therefore expected that these ecosystems support a plankton diversity that differs notably from other freshwater lakes. In addition, we hypothesized that the communities under study exhibit geographic structuring. Our rationale was that geographic dispersal of small-sized eukaryotes in high-mountain lakes over continental distances seems difficult. We analysed hypervariable V4 fragments of the SSU rRNA gene to compare the genetic microbial eukaryote diversity in high-mountain lakes located in the European Alps, the Chilean Altiplano and the Ethiopian Bale Mountains. Microbial eukaryotes were not globally distributed corroborating patterns found for bacteria, multicellular animals and plants. Instead, the plankton community composition emerged as a highly specific fingerprint of a geographic region even on higher taxonomic levels. The intraregional heterogeneity of the investigated lakes was mirrored in shifts in microbial eukaryote community structure, which, however, was much less pronounced compared with interregional beta-diversity. Statistical analyses revealed that on a regional scale, environmental factors are strong predictors for plankton community structures in high-mountain lakes. While on long-distance scales ({\textgreater}10 000 km), isolation by distance is the most plausible scenario, on intermediate scales (up to 6000 km), both contemporary environmental factors and historical contingencies interact to shift plankton community structures.},

abstract = {Microbes occupy diverse ecological niches and only through recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has the true microbial diversity been revealed. Furthermore, lack of perceivable marine barriers to genetic dispersal (i.e. mountains or islands) has allowed the speculation that organisms that can be easily transported by currents and therefore proliferate everywhere. That said, ocean fronts are now commonly being recognised as barriers for microbial dispersal. Here we analysed samples collected from a total of six stations, four located in the Indian Ocean and two in the Southern Ocean, i.e., either side of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). Amplicon sequencing was used to characterise both prokaryotic and eukaryotic plankton communities, whilst shotgun sequencing was used for the combined environmental DNA (eDNA), microbial eDNA (meDNA) and viral fractions. We found that Cyanobacteria dominated the prokaryotic component in the South-West Indian Ocean, while $\gamma$-Proteobacteria dominated the South-East Indian Ocean. A combination of $\gamma$- and $\alpha$-Proteobacteria dominated the Southern Ocean. Alveolates dominated almost exclusively the eukaryotic component, with variation in the ratio of Protoalveolata and Dinoflagellata depending on station. However, an increase in haptophyte relative abundance was observed in the Southern Ocean. Similarly, the viral fraction was dominated by members of the order Caudovirales across all stations; however, a higher presence of NCLDVs (mainly chloroviruses and mimiviruses) was observed in the Southern Ocean.

abstract = {Ciliates are powerful indicators for monitoring the impact of aquaculture and other industrial activities in the marine environment. Here, we tested the efficiency of four different genetic markers (V4 and V9 regions of the SSU rRNA gene, D1 and D2 regions of the LSU rRNA gene, obtained from environmental (e)DNA and environmental (e)RNA) of benthic ciliate communities for environmental monitoring. We obtained these genetic metabarcodes from sediment samples collected along a transect extending from below salmon cages toward the open sea. These data were compared to benchmark data from traditional macrofauna surveys of the same samples. In beta diversity analyses of ciliate community structures, the V4 and V9 markers had a higher resolution power for sampling sites with different degrees of organic enrichment compared to the D1 and D2 markers. The eDNA and eRNA V4 markers had a higher discriminatory power than the V9 markers. However, results obtained with the eDNA V9 marker corroborated better with the traditional macrofauna monitoring. This allows for a more direct comparison of ciliate metabarcoding with the traditional monitoring. We conclude that the ciliate eDNA V9 marker is the best choice for implementation in routine monitoring programs in marine aquaculture.},

abstract = {The diversity of protists was researched in the Alboran Sea (SW Mediterranean Sea) by means of high throughput sequencing technologies based on the amplification of the V9 region of 18S rRNA. Samples were collected at different depths in seven stations following an environmental gradient from a coastal upwelling zone to the core of an oligotrophic anticyclonic gyre (AG). Sampling was performed during summer, when the water column was stratified. The super-phyla Alveolata, Stramenopila and Rhizaria accounted for 84{\%} of the total Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). The most diverse groups were Dinophyceae (21{\%} of OTUs), MALV-II (20{\%}), Ciliophora (9{\%}) and MALV-I (6{\%}). In terms of read abundance, the predominant groups were Dinophyceae (29{\%}), Bacillariophyta (14{\%}), MALV-II (11{\%}) and Ciliophora (11{\%}). Samples clustered into three groups according to the sampling depth and position. The shallow community in coastal stations presented distinguishable patterns of diatoms and cilliates compared to AG stations. These results indicate that there was a strong horizontal coupling between phytoplankton and ciliate communities. Abundance of radiolaria and Syndiniales increased with depth. Our analyses demonstrate that the stratification disruption produced by the AG caused shifts in the trophic ecology of the plankton assemblages inducing a transition from bottom-up to top-down control.},

abstract = {The microbial taxonomic composition of the three domains of life in two coastal plankton samples was assessed by random total community metagenomic sequencing and PCR-based rDNA amplicon deep-sequencing in order to compare the resulting diversity and investigate possible limitations and complementarities of each method. The various universal primer sets, used to amplify different hypervariable rDNA regions, revealed the same major high-level taxonomic groups in Bacteria and unicellular Eukaryota, and showed a scarce Archaea apparent richness. However, significant differences were found between the different primer sets (p-value {\textless} 0.05, with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), regarding both operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness and relative abundance of the major high-level taxonomic groups detected. Based on the metagenomic approach, the phylum Bacteroidetes dominated the prokaryotic community, followed by Proteobacteria, while the detected eukaryotic unicellular taxa belonged to the groups of Alveolata, Fungi, Chlorophyta, Stramenopiles and Phaeophyceae. These groups were found to carry genes typically found in microbial communities, which are linked to DNA, RNA and protein metabolism and the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, carbohydrates and vitamins. Although our findings suggest that the total community metagenomic approach can provide a more comprehensive picture of the planktonic microbial community structure, a number of issues associated with this approach emerged. These issues include the still relatively high cost compared to amplicon sequencing, the possible low coverage of the full marine diversity, the insufficiency of databases for other gene markers than the small subunit gene, and the bias towards bacterial sequences because of their higher abundance relative to eukaryotes in marine environments.},

The aim of the study was to investigate the underexplored diversity of marine unicellular eukaryotes in four different sampling sites in Thessaloniki Bay during a year of plankton blooms, red tides, and mucilage aggregates. High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) was applied in extracted DNA from weekly water samples targeting the 18S rRNA gene. In almost all samples, phytoplankton blooms and/or red tides and mucilage aggregates were observed. The metabarcoding analysis has detected the known unicellular eukaryotic groups frequently observed in the Bay, dominated by Bacillariophyta and Dinoflagellata, and revealed taxonomic groups previously undetected in the study area (MALVs, MAST, and Cercozoa). The dominant OTUs were closely related to species known to participate in red tides, harmful blooms, and mucilage aggregates. Other OTUs, present also during the blooms in low abundance (number of reads), were closely related to known harmful species, suggesting the occurrence of rare taxa with potential negative impacts on human health not detectable with classical microscopy. Overall, the unicellular eukaryote assemblages showed temporal patterns rather than small-scale spatial separation responding to the variability of physical and chemical factors.},

abstract = {How much temporal recurrence is present in microbial assemblages is still an unanswered ecological question. Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long-term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA-gene data from two organismal size-fractions: the picoplankton (0.2-3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3-20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups like Mamiellophyceae or MALV-III presented clear recurrence (i.e. seasonality), whereas 13-19{\%} of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for {\~{}}40{\%} of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long-term whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non-recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.},

Yet, our understanding of their community composition and activity in different water layers of the ocean is limited, particularly for picoeukaryotes (0.2-3 $\mu$m cell size). Here we examined the picoeukaryotic communities inhabiting different vertical zones of the tropical and subtropical global ocean: surface, deep chlorophyll maximum, mesopelagic (including the deep scattering layer and minimum oxygen zone) and bathypelagic. Communities were analysed by high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, as represented by DNA (community structure) and RNA (metabolic expression), followed by delineation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). We found a clear stratification of the picoeukaryotic communities along the water column, with two differentiated assemblages corresponding to the sunlit and dark ocean. Specific taxonomic groups either increased or decreased their abundances with depth. We used the rRNA:rDNA ratio of each individual OTU as a proxy of its metabolic activity. The highest relative activity was found in the mesopelagic layer for most taxonomic groups, and the lowest in the bathypelagic. Overall, our results characterize the change in community structure and activity of picoeukaryotes in the global-ocean water column, suggesting that the mesopeagic layer is a hot-spot of picoeukaryotic activity.},

abstract = {Summer upwelling off Hainan Island (northern South China Sea) is influenced by fresher coastal water masses. To assess the ecological effects of this complicated oceanography, a cruise was conducted in August 2016. We investigated the spatial patterns of phytoplankton size structure, diversity and quantity of small eukaryotes (0.2–20 $\mu$m) across the upwelling system. In the inner-shelf waters, nanophytoplankton contributed a higher proportion to phytoplankton biomass than microphytoplankton and picophytoplankton. High-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA genes and community analysis indicated that the horizontal variation in community structure of small eukaryotes was larger than the vertical. The relative sequence proportions of dinoflagellates, diatoms, ciliates and Micromonas in the surface layer gradually decreased from the inner shelf to the slope, whereas the Rhizaria, Bathycoccus and Ostreococcus exhibited an opposite trend. The spatial patterns of taxon-specific rDNA copy numbers were similar to the patterns based on the relative proportions. Redundancy analysis revealed that turbidity, salinity and {\$}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}NO{\}}{\}}{\_}3{\^{}}{\{}-{\}}{\$} were the most important environmental variables in structuring the community of small eukaryotes. The cell abundance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes was significantly correlated with the rDNA abundance of Mamiellophyceae and the cell abundance of nanoeukaryotes was significantly correlated with the rDNA abundance of dinoflagellates plus diatoms.},

Samples were collected in August 2013 at the Outer Oslofjorden, Norway. Total RNA/cDNA was amplified by haptophyte-specific primers targeting the V4 region of the 18S, and the D1-D2 region of the 28S rRNA. Taxonomy was assigned using curated haptophyte reference databases and phylogenetic analyses. Both marker genes showed Chrysochromulinaceae and Prymnesiaceae to be the families with highest number of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), as well as proportional abundance. The 18S rRNA data set also contained OTUs assigned to eight supported and defined clades consisting of environmental sequences only, possibly representing novel lineages from family to class. We also recorded new species for the area. Comparing coccolithophores by SEM with metabarcoding shows a good correspondence with the 18S rRNA gene proportional abundances. Our results contribute to link morphological and molecular data and 28S to 18S rRNA gene sequences of haptophytes without cultured representatives, and to improve metabarcoding methodology.},

abstract = {This study investigated the genetic diversity of phytoplankton communities in six shallow lagoons located on the French coast of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea that represented a trophic gradient ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. The phytoplankton communities were sampled once a month from spring (May) to the beginning of autumn (September/early October) in 2012 and fractionated by size. Metabarcodes were generated from cDNAs by targeting the D1-D2 region of the 28S rRNA gene and pyrosequenced using Roche 454 technology. Examination of the annotated barcodes revealed harmful algal species not previously documented in these lagoons. Three ichthyotoxic species belonging to Pfiesteriaceae were detected: Luciella masanensis was relatively widespread and abundant in many samples, whereas Pfiesteria piscicida and Stoeckeria changwonensis were found as single barcode sequences. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of barcodes annotated as belonging to Pfiesteriaceae suggested the existence of two previously undescribed clades. The other toxic or potentially harmful dinoflagellates detected through rare barcodes were Dinophysis acuminata, Vulcanodinium rugosum, Alexandrium andersonii and A. ostenfeldii. The two most abundant dinoflagellate taxa were Gymnodinium litoralis and Akashiwo sanguinea with respect to sequence numbers. Four diatom species from the genus Pseudo-nitzschia that potentially produce domoic acid were identified (P. galaxiae, P. delicatissima, P. brasiliana and P. calliantha). These observations are discussed in terms of the literature and monitoring records related to the identified taxa in this Mediterranean area.},

abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is widely used to study prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial diversity. Technological constraints limit most studies to marker lengths below 600 base pairs (bp). Longer sequencing reads of several thousand bp are now possible with third-generation sequencing. Increased marker lengths provide greater taxonomic resolution and allow for phylogenetic methods of classification, but longer reads may be subject to higher rates of sequencing error and chimera formation. In addition, most bioinformatics tools for DNA metabarcoding were designed for short reads and are therefore unsuitable. Here, we used Pacific Biosciences circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to DNA-metabarcode environmental samples using a ca. 4,500 bp marker that included most of the eukaryote SSU and LSU rRNA genes and the complete ITS region. We developed an analysis pipeline that reduced error rates to levels comparable to short-read platforms. Validation using a mock community indicated that our pipeline detected 98{\%} of chimeras de novo. We recovered 947 OTUs from water and sediment samples from a natural lake, 848 of which could be classified to phylum, 397 to genus and 330 to species. By allowing for the simultaneous use of three databases (Unite, SILVA and RDP LSU), long-read DNA metabarcoding provided better taxonomic resolution than any single marker. We foresee the use of long reads enabling the cross-validation of reference sequences and the synthesis of ribosomal rRNA gene databases. The universal nature of the rRNA operon and our recovery of {\textgreater}100 nonfungal OTUs indicate that long-read DNA metabarcoding holds promise for studies of eukaryotic diversity more broadly.},

abstract = {Molecular analysis revealed diel rhythmicity in the metabolic activity of single-celled microbial eukaryotes (protists) within an eddy in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (ca. 100 km NE of station ALOHA). Diel trends among different protistan taxonomic groups reflected distinct nutritional capabilities and temporal niche partitioning. Changes in relative metabolic activities among phototrophs corresponded to the light cycle, generally peaking in mid- to late-afternoon. Metabolic activities of protistan taxa with phagotrophic ability were higher at night, relative to daytime, potentially in response to increased availability of picocyanobacterial prey. Tightly correlated Operational Taxonomic Units throughout the diel cycle implicated the existence of parasitic and mutualistic relationships within the microbial eukaryotic community, underscoring the need to define and include these symbiotic interactions in marine food web descriptions. This study provided a new high-resolution view into the ecologically important interactions among primary producers and consumers that mediate the transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels. Characterizations of the temporal dynamics of protistan activities contribute knowledge for predicting how these microorganisms respond to environmental forcing factors.},

abstract = {Microbial plankton form the productive base of both marine and freshwater ecosystems and are key drivers of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients. Plankton diversity is immense with representations from all major phyla within the three domains of life. So far, plankton monitoring has mainly been based on microscopic identification, which has limited sensitivity and reproducibility, not least because of the numerical majority of plankton being unidentifiable under the light microscope. High-throughput sequencing of taxonomic marker genes offers a means to identify taxa inaccessible by traditional methods; thus, recent studies have unveiled an extensive previously unknown diversity of plankton. Here, we conducted ultra-deep Illumina sequencing (average 10 5 sequences/sample) of rRNA gene amplicons of surface water eukaryotic and bacterial plankton communities sampled in summer along a 2000 km transect following the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea. Community composition was strongly correlated with salinity for both bacterial and eukaryotic plankton assemblages, highlighting the importance of salinity for structuring the biodiversity within this ecosystem. In contrast, no clear trends in alpha-diversity for bacterial or eukaryotic communities could be detected along the transect. The distribution of major planktonic taxa followed expected patterns as observed in monitoring programs, but groups novel to the Baltic Sea were also identified, such as relatives to the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi detected in the northern Baltic Sea. This study provides the first ultra-deep sequencing-based survey on eukaryotic and bacterial plankton biogeography in the Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {The Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM) is a distinct hydrographic phenomenon of the Yellow Sea, and the distribution pattern of meio- and macrobenthos differs inside and outside of the YSCWM. However, such a pattern has never been observed in the microbenthic ciliate communities. Therefore, we hypothesized that benthic ciliates followed a similar distribution pattern as meio- and macrobenthos, but this pattern has not been uncovered by morphological methods. We evaluated the diversity and distribution of benthic ciliates at five stations along hydrographic gradients across the YSCWM and adjacent shallow water by using morphology and DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of 18S rRNA gene. Results showed that the diversity of benthic ciliates detected by DNA (303 OTUs), and the cDNA (611 OTUs) sequencing was much higher than that detected by the morphological method (79 species). Morphological method detected roughly different ciliate communities inside and outside of the YSCWM, but without statistical significance. No clear pattern was obtained by DNA sequencing. In contrast, cDNA sequencing revealed a distinct distribution pattern of benthic ciliate communities like meio-and macrobenthos, which coincided well with the results of the environmental parameter analysis. More than half of the total sequences detected by DNA sequencing belonged to planktonic ciliates, most (if not all) of which were recovered from historic DNA originating through the sedimentation of pelagic forms because none of them were observed morphologically. The irrelevant historic DNA greatly influenced the recovery of rare species and thus limited the understanding of the benthic ciliate diversity and distribution. Our research indicates that the methods used have significant effects on the investigation of benthic ciliate communities and highlights that cDNA sequencing has great advantages in estimating the diversity and distribution of benthic ciliates, as well as the potential for benthic environmental assessments.},

abstract = {The ocean is home to myriad small planktonic organisms that underpin the functioning of marine ecosystems. However, their spatial patterns of diversity and the underlying drivers remain poorly known, precluding projections of their responses to global changes. Here we investigate the latitudinal gradients and global predictors of plankton diversity across archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and major virus clades using both molecular and imaging data from Tara Oceans. We show a decline of diversity for most planktonic groups toward the poles, mainly driven by decreasing ocean temperatures. Projections into the future suggest that severe warming of the surface ocean by the end of the 21st century could lead to tropicalization of the diversity of most planktonic groups in temperate and polar regions. These changes may have multiple consequences for marine ecosystem functioning and services and are expected to be particularly significant in key areas for carbon sequestration, fisheries, and marine conservation.

abstract = {Background: Eukaryotes are ubiquitous in natural environments such as soil and freshwater. Little is known of their presence in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) or of the environmental conditions that affect their activity and survival. Methods: Eukaryotes were characterized by Illumina high-throughput sequencing targeting 18S rRNA gene (DNA) that estimates the total community and the 18S rRNA gene transcript (RNA) that is more representative of the active part of the community. DWDS cold water (N = 124), hot water (N = 40), and biofilm (N = 16) samples were collected from four cities in Finland. The sampled DWDSs were from two waterworks A-B with non-disinfected, recharged groundwater as source water and from three waterworks utilizing chlorinated water (two DWDSs of surface waterworks C-D and one of ground waterworks E). In each DWDS, samples were collected from three locations during four seasons of 1 year. Results: A beta-diversity analysis revealed that the main driver shaping the eukaryotic communities was the DWDS (A-E) (R = 0.73, P {\textless} 0.001, ANOSIM). The kingdoms Chloroplastida (green plants and algae), Metazoa (animals: rotifers, nematodes), Fungi (e.g., Cryptomycota), Alveolata (ciliates, dinoflagellates), and Stramenopiles (algae Ochrophyta) were well represented and active - judging based on the rRNA gene transcripts - depending on the surrounding conditions. The unchlorinated cold water of systems (A-B) contained a higher estimated total number of taxa (Chao1, average 380-480) than chlorinated cold water in systems C-E (Chao1 ≤ 210). Within each DWDS, unique eukaryotic communities were identified at different locations as was the case also for cold water, hot water, and biofilms. A season did not have a consistent impact on the eukaryotic community among DWDSs. Conclusions: This study comprehensively characterized the eukaryotic community members within the DWDS of well-maintained ground and surface waterworks providing good quality water. The study gives an indication that each DWDS houses a unique eukaryotic community, mainly dependent on the raw water source and water treatment processes in place at the corresponding waterworks. In particular, disinfection as well as hot water temperature seemed to represent a strong selection pressure that controlled the number of active eukaryotic species.},

abstract = {High-throughput DNA metabarcoding of amplicon sizes below 500 bp has revolutionized the analysis of environmental microbial diversity. However, these short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. This lesser phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons may be overcome by new long-read sequencing technologies. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain an {\~{}}4500-bp region spanning most of the eukaryotic small subunit (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal DNA genes. We first treated the CCS reads with a novel curation workflow, generating 650 high-quality operational taxonomic units (OTUs) containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions. To assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based methods. The taxonomically annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing us to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1,019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58{\%}) corresponded to the new long environmental OTUs. The long reads also allowed us to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny. Together, our results show that long amplicons can be treated in a full phylogenetic framework to provide greater taxonomic resolution and a robust evolutionary perspective to environmental DNA.},

abstract = {Tree canopies provide habitats for diverse and until now, still poorly characterised communities of microbial eukaryotes. One of the most general patterns in community ecology is the increase in species richness with increasing habitat diversity. Thus, environmental heterogeneity of tree canopies should be an important factor governing community structure and diversity in this subsystem of forest ecosystems. Nevertheless, it is unknown if similar patterns are reflected at the microbial scale within unicellular eukaryotes (protists). In this study, high-throughput sequencing of two prominent protistan taxa, Cercozoa and Oomycota, was performed. For a comprehensive assessment of their diversity across all ecological compartments from forest soils to the canopy, group specific primers were used. When taking OTU abundances into account, our results showed highly dissimilar protistan communities within the investigated microhabitats. We observed no pattern of nestedness, because the majority of OTUs was present in all sampled microhabitats. According to the microbiological tenet ‘Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects', habitat diversity strongly favoured distinct protistan taxa in terms of abundance, but due to their almost ubiquitous distribution the effect of species richness on community composition was negligible.},

abstract = {Background: The soil mycobiome is composed of a complex and diverse fungal community, which includes functionally diverse species ranging from plant pathogens to mutualists. Among the latter are arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that provide phosphorous (P) to plants. While plant hosts and abiotic parameters are known to structure AMF communities, it remains largely unknown how higher trophic level organisms, including protists and nematodes, affect AMF abundance and community composition. Results: Here, we explored the connections between AMF, fungivorous protists and nematodes that could partly reflect trophic interactions, and linked those to rhizosphere P dynamics and plant performance in a long-Term manure application setting. Our results revealed that manure addition increased AMF biomass and the density of fungivorous nematodes, and tailored the community structures of AMF, fungivorous protists, and nematodes. We detected a higher abundance of AMF digested by the dominant fungivorous nematodes Aphelenchoides and Aphelenchus in high manure treatments compared to no manure and low manure treatments. Structural equation modeling combined with network analysis suggested that predation by fungivorous protists and nematodes stimulated AMF biomass and modified the AMF community composition. The mycorrhizal-fungivore interactions catalyzed AMF colonization and expression levels of the P transporter gene ZMPht1;6 in maize roots, which resulted in enhanced plant productivity. Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of predation as a key element in shaping the composition and enhancing the biomass of AMF, leading to increased plant performance. As such, we clarify novel biological mechanism of the complex interactions between AMF, fungivorous protists, and nematodes in driving P absorption and plant performance.

abstract = {Picoeukaryotes play prominent roles in the biogeochemical cycles in marine ecosystems. However, their molecular diversity studies have been confined in marine surface waters or shallow coastal sediments. Here, we investigated the diversity and metabolic activity of picoeukaryotic communities at depths ranging from the surface to the abyssopelagic zone in the western Pacific Ocean above the north and south slopes of the Mariana Trench. This was achieved by amplifying and sequencing the V4 region of both 18S ribosomal DNA and cDNA using Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Our study revealed: (1) Four super-groups (i.e., Alveolata, Opisthokonta, Rhizaria and Stramenopiles) dominated the picoeukaryote assemblages through the water column, although they accounted for different proportions at DNA and cDNA levels. Our data expand the deep-sea assemblages from current bathypelagic to abyssopelagic zones. (2) Using the cDNA-DNA ratio as a proxy of relative metabolic activity, the highest activity for most subgroups was usually found in the mesopelagic zone; and (3) Population shift along the vertical scale was more prominent than that on the horizontal differences, which might be explained by the sharp physicochemical gradients along the water depths. Overall, our study provides a better understanding of the diversity and metabolic activity of picoeukaryotes in water columns of the deep ocean in response to varying environmental conditions.},

abstract = {We experimentally evaluated the temporal (in-terday and interseason) and spatial variability in microbial plankton responses to vitamin B12 and/or B1 supply (solely or in combination with inorganic nutrients) in coastal and oceanic waters of the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Phytoplank-ton and, to a lesser extent, prokaryotes were strongly limited by inorganic nutrients. Interday variability in microbial plankton responses to B vitamins was limited compared to interseason variability, suggesting that B-vitamin availability might be partially controlled by factors operating at seasonal scale. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and prokaryote biomass (PB) significantly increased after B-vitamin amendments in 13 {\%} and 21 {\%}, respectively, of the 216 cases (36 experiments × 6 treatments). Most of these positive responses were produced by treatments containing either B12 solely or B12 combined with B1 in oceanic waters , which was consistent with the significantly lower average vitamin-B12 ambient concentrations compared to that in the coastal station. Negative responses, implying a decrease in Chl a or PB, represented 21 {\%} for phytoplank-ton and 26 {\%} for prokaryotes. Growth stimulation by B1 addition was more frequent on prokaryotes than in phyto-plankton, suggesting that B1 auxotrophy in the sampling area could be more widespread in prokaryotes than in phy-toplankton. Negative responses to B vitamins were generalized in coastal surface waters in summer and were associated with a high contribution of Flavobacteriales to the prokary-ote community. This observation suggests that the external supply of B12 and/or B1 may promote negative interactions between microbial components when B-vitamin auxotrophs are abundant. The microbial response patterns to B12 and/or B1 amendments were significantly correlated with changes in the prokaryotic community composition, highlighting the pivotal role of prokaryotes in B-vitamin cycling in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {The dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates have been monitored for many decades at the Helgoland Roads Long-Term Ecological Research site and are relatively well understood. In contrast, small-sized eukaryotic microbes and their community changes are still much more elusive, mainly due to their small size and uniform morphology, which makes them difficult to identify microscopically. By using next-generation sequencing, we wanted to shed light on the Helgoland planktonic community dynamics, including nano- and picoplankton, during a spring bloom. We took samples from March to May 2016 and sequenced the V4 region of the 18S rDNA. Our results showed that mixotrophic and heterotrophic taxa were more abundant than autotrophic diatoms. Dinoflagellates dominated the sequence assemblage, and several small-sized eukaryotic microbes like Haptophyta, Choanoflagellata, Marine Stramenopiles and Syndiniales were identified. A diverse background community including taxa from all size classes was present during the whole sampling period. Five phases with several communities were distinguished. The fastest changes in community composition took place in phase 3, while the communities from phases 1 to 5 were more similar to each other despite contrasting environmental conditions. Synergy effects of next-generation sequencing and traditional methods may be exploited in future long-term observations.},

The importance of parasites and parasitoids for food web dynamics has previously been recognized mostly in terrestrial and freshwater systems, while marine planktonic parasitoids have been understudied in comparison to those. Therefore, the occurrence and role of parasites and parasitoids remains mostly unconsidered in the marine environment. We observed high abundances and diversity of parasitoid operational taxonomic units in our dataset all year round. While some parasitoid groups were present throughout the year and merely fluctuated in abundances, we also detected a succession of parasitoid groups with peaks of individual species only during certain seasons. Using co-occurrence and patterns of seasonal occurrence, we were able to identify known host-parasitoid dynamics, however identification of new potential host-parasitoid interactions was not possible due to their high dynamics and variability in the dataset.},

Flow cytometry was applied to sort small photosynthetic eukaryotes ({\textless}5 $\mu$m), and high-throughput sequencing of 18S rDNA was performed. Our taxonomic analysis showed that 19/195 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were frequently distributed among all sites. Composition analysis showed that the OTUs had characteristic patterns and were divided into four main groups. Two groups reflected the low-saline water and winter season, with the characteristic OTUs belonging to diatoms; Chaetoceros and Leptocylindrus were characteristic of low saline water, and two diatom genera (Minidiscus and Minutocellus) and Cryptomonadales-related OTUs were prevalent in the winter. Our results indicate that the community composition of small photosynthetic eukaryotes seasonally changes in a dynamic manner according to variations in water properties.},

Yet it remains unclear how and the extent to which lake biodiversity has changed during the Anthropocene, in particular for microbes. Here, we used DNA preserved in sediments to compare modern micro-eukaryotic communities with those from the end of the 19th century, i.e., before acceleration of the human imprint on ecosystems. Our results obtained for 48 lakes indicate drastic changes in the composition of microbial communities, coupled with a homogenization of their diversity between lakes. Remote high elevation lakes were globally less impacted than lowland lakes affected by local human activity. All functional groups (micro-algae, parasites, saprotrophs and consumers) underwent significant changes in diversity. However, we show that the effects of anthropogenic changes have benefited in particular phototrophic and mixotrophic species, which is consistent with the hypothesis of a global increase of primary productivity in lakes.},

abstract = {Despite their obvious importance, our knowledge about the eukaryotic microbial diversity of inland waters is still limited and poorly documented. We applied 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing to provide a comprehensive analysis of eukaryotic diversity in 74 low-productivity lakes along a 750 km longitudinal transect (5.40-18.52 degrees E) across southern Scandinavia. We detected a wide diversity of pelagic microbial eukaryotes, classified into 1882 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The highest OTU richness was found in traditional phytoplankton groups like Dinoflagellata, Chrysophyceae, Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta. A total of 53.6{\%} OTUs were primarily autotrophic, while 19.4{\%} of the heterotrophic OTUs belonged to putative parasitic taxa. Except for a longitudinal trend in the relative influence of mixotrophs, there were no significant associations between major functional groups (autotrophs, heterotrophs and parasites) and spatial and environmental variables. Community dissimilarity increased significantly with increasing geographical distance between lakes. In accordance with earlier, microscopy-based surveys in this region, we demonstrate distinct gradients in protistan diversity and community composition, which are better explained by spatial structure than local environment. The strong association between longitude and protistan diversity is probably better explained by differences in regional species pools due to differences in landscape productivity than by dispersal limitation or climatic constraints.},

In this study, we used 454-pyrosequencing to study picoplankton communities at four stations in the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC; Fram Strait). High abundances of Micromonas pusilla were detected in the station situated closest to Spitsbergen, as seen in surveys of picoplankton assemblages in the Beaufort Sea. At the other three stations, other phylotypes, affiliating with Phaeocystis pouchetii and Syndiniales in the phylogenetic tree, were present in high numbers, dominating most of them. The picoplankton community structures at three of the stations, all with similar salinity and temperature, were alike. At the fourth station, the influence of the East Spitsbergen Current, transporting cold water from the Barents Sea around Spitsbergen, causes different abiotic parameters that result in a significantly different picoeukaryote community composition, which is dominated by M. pusilla. This observation is particularly interesting with regard to ongoing environmental changes in the Arctic. Ongoing warming of the WSC could convey a new picoplankton assemblage into the Arctic Ocean, which may come to affect the dominance of M. pusilla.},

Three stations (T1; T5; T7) were influenced by Polar Water, characterized by cold water with lower salinity ({\textless}33) and different extents of ice concentrations. Atlantic Water influenced the other two stations (T6; T9). While T6 was located in the mixed water zone characterized by cold water with intermediate salinity ({\~{}}33) and high ice concentrations, T9 was located in warm water with high salinity ({\~{}}35) and no ice-coverage at all. General trends in community structure according to prevailing environmental settings, observed with both methods, coincided well. At two stations, T1 and T7, characterized by lower ice concentrations, diatoms (Fragilariopsis sp., Porosira sp., Thalassiosira spp.) dominated the protist community. The third station (T5) was ice-covered, but has been ice-free for {\~{}}4 weeks prior to sampling. At this station, dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae 1, Woloszynskia sp. and Gyrodinium sp.) were dominant, reflecting a post-bloom situation. At station T6 and T9, the protist communities consisted mainly of picoeukaryotes, e.g., Micromonas spp. Based on our results, 454-pyrosequencing has proven to be an adequate tool to provide comprehensive information on the composition of protist communities. Furthermore, this study suggests that a snap-shot of a few, but well-chosen samples can provide an overview of community structure patterns and succession in a dynamic marine environment.},

abstract = {The globally abundant, uncultured unicellular cyanobacterium UCYN-A was recently discovered living in association with a eukaryotic cell closely related to a prymnesiophyte. Here, we established a double CAtalysed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) approach to identify both partners and provided quantitative information on their distribution and abundance across distinct water masses along a transect in the North Atlantic Ocean. The N2 fixation activity coincided with the detection of UCYN-A cells and was only observed in oligotrophic ({\textless} 0.067 N O 3 −  $\mu$M and {\textless} 0.04 P O 4 3 −  $\mu$M) and warm ({\textgreater} 18°C) surface waters. Parallel 16S ribosomal RNA gene analyses among unicellular diazotrophs indicated that only UCYN-A cells were present. UCYN-A cells were associated with an algal partner or non-associated using the double CARD-FISH approach. We demonstrated that UCYN-A cells living in association with Haptophyta were the dominant form (87.0 ± 6.1{\%}), whereas non-associated UCYN-A cells represented only a minor fraction (5.2 ± 3.9{\%}). Interestingly, UCYN-A cells were also detected living in association with unknown single-celled eukaryotes in small amounts (7.8 ± 5.2{\%}), presumably Alveolata. The proposed ecological niche of UCYN-A as an oligotrophic, mesophilic and obligate symbiotic nitrogen-fixing microorganism is evident for the North Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Assessing how natural environmental drivers affect biodiversity underpins our understanding of the relationships between complex biotic and ecological factors in natural ecosystems. Of all ecosystems, anthropogenically important estuaries represent a 'melting pot' of environmental stressors, typified by extreme salinity variations and associated biological complexity. Although existing models attempt to predict macroorganismal diversity over estuarine salinity gradients, attempts to model microbial biodiversity are limited for eukaryotes. Although diatoms commonly feature as bioindicator species, additional microbial eukaryotes represent a huge resource for assessing ecosystem health. Of these, meiofaunal communities may represent the optimal compromise between functional diversity that can be assessed using morphology and phenotype-environment interactions as compared with smaller life fractions. Here, using 454 Roche sequencing of the 18S nSSU barcode we investigate which of the local natural drivers are most strongly associated with microbial metazoan and sampled protist diversity across the full salinity gradient of the estuarine ecosystem. In order to investigate potential variation at the ecosystem scale, we compare two geographically proximate estuaries (Thames and Mersey, UK) with contrasting histories of anthropogenic stress. The data show that although community turnover is likely to be predictable, taxa are likely to respond to different environmental drivers and, in particular, hydrodynamics, salinity range and granulometry, according to varied life-history characteristics. At the ecosystem level, communities exhibited patterns of estuary-specific similarity within different salinity range habitats, highlighting the environmental sequencing biomonitoring potential of meiofauna, dispersal effects or both.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 25 November 2014; doi:10.1038/ismej.2014.213.},

abstract = {Seasonality in marine microorganisms has been classically observed in phytoplankton blooms, and more recently studied at the community level in prokaryotes, but rarely investigated at the scale of individual microbial taxa across the three domains of life. Here we test if specific marine eukaryotic, bacterial and archaeal taxa display yearly rhythms at a coastal site impacted by irregular environmental perturbations. Our seven-year study in the Bay of Banyuls (North Western Mediterranean Sea) shows that despite some fluctuating environmental conditions, many microbial taxa displayed significant yearly rhythms. The robust rhythmicity was found in both autotrophs (picoeukaryotes and cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic prokaryotes. Sporadic meteorological events and irregular nutrient supplies did, however, trigger the appearance of less common non-rhythmic taxa. Among the environmental parameters that were measured, the main drivers of rhythmicity were temperature and day length. Seasonal autotrophs may thus be setting the pace for rhythmic heterotrophs as there are no real evidence of a genuine circadian clock in the latter. Similar environmental niches may be driving seasonality as well. The observed strong association between Micromonas and SAR11 OTUs, which both need thiamine precursors for growth, could be a first indication that shared nutritional niches may indeed explain some rhythmic patterns of co-occurrence.},

abstract = {As global exploitation of available resources increases, operations extend towards sensitive and previously protected ecosystems. It is important to monitor such areas in order to detect, understand and remediate environmental responses to stressors. The natural heterogeneity and complexity of communities means that accurate monitoring requires high resolution, both temporally and spatially, as well as more complete assessments of taxa. Increased resolution and taxonomic coverage is economically challenging using current microscopy-based monitoring practices. Alternatively, DNA sequencing-based methods have been suggested for cost-efficient monitoring, offering additional insights into ecosystem function and disturbance. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding of eukaryotic communities in marine sediments, in areas of offshore drilling on the Norwegian continental shelf. Forty-five samples, collected from seven drilling sites in the Troll/Oseberg region, were assessed, using the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene as a taxonomic marker. In agreement with results based on classical morphology-based monitoring, we were able to identify changes in sediment communities surrounding oil platforms. In addition to overall changes in community structure, we identified several potential indicator taxa, responding to pollutants associated with drilling fluids. These included the metazoan orders Macrodasyida, Macrostomida and Ceriantharia, as well as several ciliates and other protist taxa, typically not targeted by environmental monitoring programmes. Analysis of a co-occurrence network to study the distribution of taxa across samples provided a framework for better understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities on the benthic food web, generating novel, testable hypotheses of trophic interactions structuring benthic communities.},

abstract = {Human impact on marine benthic communities has traditionally been assessed using visible morphological traits and has focused on the macrobenthos, whereas the ecologically impor- tant organisms of the meio- and microbenthos have received less attention. DNA metabar- coding offers an alternative to this approach and enables a larger fraction of the biodiversity in marine sediments to be monitored in a cost-efficient manner. Although this methodology remains poorly standardised and challenged by biases inherent to rRNA copy number varia- tion, DNA extraction, PCR, and limitations related to taxonomic identification, it has been shown to be semi-quantitative and useful for comparing taxon abundances between sam- ples. Here, we evaluate the effect of replicating genomic DNA extraction in order to counter- act small scale spatial heterogeneity and improve diversity and community structure estimates in metabarcoding-based monitoring. For this purpose, we used ten technical repli- cates from three different marine sediment samples. The effect of sequence depth was also assessed, and in silico pooling of DNA extraction replicates carried out in order to maintain the number of reads constant. Our analyses demonstrated that both sequencing depth and DNA extraction replicates could improve diversity estimates as well as the ability to separate samples with different characteristics. Wecould not identify a “sufficient” replicate number or sequence depth, where further improvements had a less significant effect. Based on these results, we consider replication an attractive alternative to directly increasing the amount of sample used for DNA extraction and strongly recommend it for future metabar- coding studies and routine assessments of sediment biodiversity.},

abstract = {Human‐induced global change dramatically alters individual aspects of river biodiversity, such as taxonomic, phylogenetic or functional diversity, and is predicted to lead to losses of associated ecosystem functions. Understanding these losses and dependencies are critical to human well‐being. Until now, however, most studies have only looked either at individual organismal groups or single functions, and little is known on the effect of human activities on multitrophic biodiversity and on ecosystem multifunctionality in riverine ecosystem. Here, we profiled biodiversity from bacteria to invertebrates based on environmental DNA (hereafter, 'eDNA') samples across a major river catchment in China, and analyzed their dependencies with multiple ecosystem functions, especially linked to C/N/P‐cycling. Firstly, we found a spatial cross‐taxon congruence pattern of communities' structure in the network of the Shaying river, which was related to strong environmental filtering due to human land‐use. Secondly, human land‐use explained the decline of multitrophic and multifaceted biodiversity and ecosystem functions, but increased functional redundancy in the riverine ecosystem. Thirdly, biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships at an integrative level showed a concave‐up (non‐saturating) shape. Finally, structural equation modelling suggested that land‐use affects ecosystem functions through biodiversity‐mediated pathways, including biodiversity loss and altered community interdependence in multitrophic groups. Our study highlights the value of a complete and inclusive assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem functions for an integrated land‐use management of riverine ecosystems.},

Their physical and chemical characteristics are unique because of the steep-walled structure and isolated water column which create isolated ecosystems in geographically restricted areas. The Sansha Yongle Blue Hole (SYBH) is the world's deepest marine blue hole. Here, we generated the first DNA metabarcoding dataset from SYBH sediment focusing on foraminifera, a group of protists that have colonized various marine environments. We collected sediment samples from SYBH along a depth gradient to characterize the foraminiferal diversity and compared them with the foraminiferal diversity of the costal Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) and the abyssal Northwest Pacific Ocean (NWP). We amplified the SSU rDNA of foraminifera and sequenced them with high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the foraminiferal assemblages in SYBH were vertically structured in response to the abiotic gradients and diversity was higher than in JZB and NWP. This study illustrates the capacity of foraminifera to colonize hostile environments and shows that blue holes are natural laboratories to explore physiological innovation associated with anoxia.},

annote = {This is an interesting paper which focuses on the composition of the photosynthetic picoplankton in 2 large Chinese lakes using a combination of flow cytometry sorting and metabarcoding. These PPE have been very little studied in lakes adn the data are bringing significantly novel knowledge. After the major remarks mentionned below are taken care of and some of the language polished I would recommend publication.


Major remarks
* The exact size range of the sorted populations should be better defined. In the paper cited (Li, S., Shi, X., Lep{\`{e}}re, C., Liu, M., Wang, X. {\&} Kong, F. 2016. Unexpected predominance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes in shallow eutrophic lakes. J. Plankton Res. 0:1–13.) the size range selected is not so clear. It should be emphasized that the size range cannot be defined using the position of beads on cytograms but needs to rely on cultures because beads have much higher scatter than algal cells. Defining the exact size range is important because many of the taxa found in this work are larger that typical PPE (e.g. diatoms).
* The assignement of the different OTUs should be made more precise. I recommend using a verified database such as PR2 (Guillou et al. 2013) and or at least the latest release of Silva which is 128 while release 108 was from a few years back. SILVA especially the old versions is not so accurate for protist taxonomy. The advantage of PR2 is that it provides 8 fixed taxonomic levels that allow easy grouping while SILVA is based on a variable number of taxonomic levels (as GenBank) that make regrouping very hard to perform. If you stick to SILVA, I think the eukaryotic taxonomy has been much improved in the latest SILVA releases. 
* The sequence and annotation of each OTU should be made available as supplementary data preferably deposited to open web site such as Figshare.
* The authors used way too many abbreviations... please only use the most common ones and spell out the rest fully...


Other remarks
l. 60. Replace "in a less extend" by "in a lower extant"
l. 62. "also led to the description of novel species". Not true: it has led to the discovery of novel taxonomic groups such as the MALV or the MAST but novel species, in almost all cases for protists, require isolation of cultures.
l. 100. What are PC and TU ?
l. 139. I do not beleive AST for "autotrophic stramenopiles" is a standard abbreviation. There is no need to add more abbreviation to the litterature which can only be confusing. So just use "autotrophic stramenopiles" everywhere.
l. 148. Haptophyceae does not exist... Use Haptophyta
l. 161. Move Supp Fig 4 to the main text.
l. 207-209. This sentence is not clear...
l. 222. "Superiority" badly expressed, maybe the "advantage"
l. 229 and elsewhere. Haptophyceae do not exist.... Use Haptophyta or the classes within Haptophyta
l. 244. The refrence is Del Campo and Massana and in this reference there is absolutely no evidence of the fact that Chrysophyceae have higher rRNA gene copy number.
l. 250. Do not use contraction such" it's" in wirttent text.
l. 251. "we firstly discovered" to be replaced by "we discovered for the first time". 
l. 252. This Ostreococcus sequence is very intriguing. It would be interesting to place in a phylogentic tree to see to which clade/species of Ostreococcus it belongs. Also the two references (Cardol et al., 2008; Demir-Hilton et al., 2011) shopuld be replaced by the original references relating the discovery of Ostreococcus .
l. 254. A more thorough analysis of the MAST sequences would be necessary. To which clade they belong and whether other freshwater sequences have been found.
l. 268. "the detected OTUs can reach a maximum of 11 times higher than that of OTUs". Sentence awkward, please rephrase.
l. 280. "These findings aggravate the enigmatic existence of the rare biosphere". This kind of sentence does not add anything... The rare biosphere is a practical concept but I do not see any point discussing it at length... This is more phylosophy than science...
l. 307. "However, this finding seems to contrast with those carried out in other water bodies" replaced by "However, this finding seems to contrast with reports in other water bodies"
l. 322. This is an interesting part... 
l. 323. "a lot" to be replaced by "a significant fraction".
l. 325. "invisible" replace by "not detected"
l. 331. "be originated" replace "originate"
l. 340. "extreme low values of relative sequences abundance of PPEs". What do you mean ? that in these samples there were very few photosynthetic sequences. Please rephrase to clarify.
l.343. "Ciliophora". Ciliates are in general quite bigger than PPE ? Therefore it is critical to estimate the size range of the sorted cells to know whether you can sorted ciliates based on the Chl signal of the ingested preys. 
l. 349-350. The loast sentence of the discussion is really abrupt... Maybe end up the discussion with a more general paragraph ?
l. 354. Please provide maps of the location of the lakes and of the stations with a bathymetric map (readers should not have to refer to another paper for this).
l. 365. please provide much more information on the population sorted including some cytograms. Agains readers should not have to refer to another paper. Please explain exactly what population was sorted and to which size range it corresponded (eg using known cultures are reference for size, beads are not enough because their scatter properties are different from algae).
l. 404. See my remarks about taxonomy assignation and the necessity to use a curated database such as PR2 or at the very least one of the latest release of SILVA.

* Table 1. What is PX Clade ? Provide a reference as a foot note. Haptophyceae do not exist. Replace by Haptophyta. To what correspond the environmental samples for each group ??? You should be able to assign more precisely based on work that has been done for each group. For Chlorophyta please look for Guillou et al. 2004. Also please be more precise within Prasinophyceae using the Guillou et al. paper as a reference.

* Fig. 2. Please detail the legend much more. What are "Observed" and ACE ?

* Fig. 3 and 6. Please use the same color codes for season.

* Fig. 4. Very very hard to read this kind of figure. Probably better split into several figures and move to supplementary. Replace by Supplementary Fig. 4 which is much more synthetic. Please provide more accurate information for all OTUs (see my remark at the start of the review). "Uncultured eukaryote" does not contain any information.... also since you for example breakup the Stramenopiles in diatoms/chryso/Other break up the legend to the right for each of these groups. 

* Supplementary table 2
- please provide the GenBank accession of the best hit.
- environmental samples is NOT a Class, please provide most likely taxonomy based on BLAST or phylogeny analysis
- Chlorella is not a Prasinophyceae but a Trebouxiophyceae. Peridiniopsis is dinoflagellate and not a diatom. Please check all taxonomy yourself and do not rely on GenBank

* Supplementary Table 3. What is PX Clade ? Provide a reference as a foot note. Haptophyceae do not exist. Replace by Haptophyta. To what correspond the environmental samples for Stramenopiles ???

* Supplementary Fig. 4. What are HST and other AST and IPDA ??? Please provide info in Figure legend.
* Suppplementary Fig. 5. Please provide more accurate information for all OTUs (see my remark at the start of the review). "Uncultured eukaryote" does not contain any information....},

abstract = {Ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS1) metabarcoding was used to investigate the distribution patterns of fungal communities and the factors influencing these patterns in subtropical Chinese seas, including the southern and northern Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea. These seas were found to harbor high levels of fungal diversity, with 816 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that span 130 known genera, 36 orders, 14 classes and 5 phyla. Ascomycota was the most abundant phylum, containing 72.18{\%} and 79.61{\%} of all OTUs and sequences, respectively, followed by Basidiomycota (19.98{\%}, 18.64{\%}), Zygomycota (1.10{\%}, 0.11{\%}), Chytridiomycota (0.25{\%}, 0.04{\%}) and Rozellomycota (0.12{\%}, 0.006{\%}). The compositions of fungal communities across these three sea regions were found to be vary, which may be attributed to sediment source, geographical distance, latitude and some environmental factors such as the temperature and salinity of bottom water, water depth, total nitrogen, and the ratio of total organic carbon to nitrogen. Among these environmental factors, the temperature of bottom water is the most important driver that governs the distribution patterns of fungal communities across the sampled seas. Our data also suggest that the cold-water mass of the Yellow Sea likely balances competitive relationships between fungal taxa rather than increasing species richness levels.},

abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) approaches are rapidly surpassing Sanger sequencing for characterizing the diversity of natural microbial communities. Despite this rapid transition, few comparisons exist between Sanger sequences and the generally much shorter reads of NGS. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) derived from full-length (Sanger sequencing) and pyrotag (454 sequencing of the V9 hypervariable region) sequences of 18S rRNA genes from 10 global samples were analyzed in order to compare the resulting protistan community structures and species richness. Pyrotag OTUs called at 98{\%} sequence similarity yielded numbers of OTUs that were similar overall to those for full-length sequences when the latter were called at 97{\%} similarity. Singleton OTUs strongly influenced estimates of species richness but not the higher-level taxonomic composition of the community. The pyrotag and full-length sequence data sets had slightly different taxonomic compositions of rhizarians, stramenopiles, cryptophytes, and haptophytes, but the two data sets had similarly high compositions of alveolates. Pyrotag-based OTUs were often derived from sequences that mapped to multiple full-length OTUs at 100{\%} similarity. Thus, pyrotags sequenced from a single hypervariable region might not be appropriate for establishing protistan species-level OTUs. However, nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots constructed with the two data sets yielded similar clusters, indicating that beta diversity analysis results were similar for the Sanger and NGS sequences. Short pyrotag sequences can provide holistic assessments of protistan communities, although care must be taken in interpreting the results. The longer reads ({\textgreater}500 bp) that are now becoming available through NGS should provide powerful tools for assessing the diversity of microbial eukaryotic assemblages.},

abstract = {Despite our current realization of the tremendous diversity that exists in plankton communities, we have little understanding of how this biodiversity influences the biological carbon pump other than broad paradigms such as diatoms contributing disproportionally to carbon export. Here we combine high-resolution underway O2/Ar, which provides an estimate of net community production, with high-throughput 18 S ribosomal DNA sequencing to elucidate the relationship between eukaryotic plankton community structure and carbon export potential at the Western Antarctica Peninsula (WAP), a region which has experienced rapid warming and ecosystem changes. Our results show that in a diverse plankton system comprised of ∼464 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with at least 97{\%} 18 S identity, as few as two or three key OTUs, i.e. large diatoms, Phaeocystis, and mixotrophic/phagotrophic dinoflagellates, can explain a large majority of the spatial variability in the carbon export potential (76-92{\%}). Moreover, we find based on a community co-occurrence network analysis that ecosystems with lower export potential have more tightly coupled communities. Our results indicate that defining plankton communities at a deeper taxonomic resolution than by functional groups and accounting for the differences in size and coupling between groups can substantially improve organic carbon flux predictions.},

abstract = {An inherent issue in high-throughput rRNA gene tag sequencing microbiome surveys is that they provide compositional data in relative abundances. This often leads to spurious correlations, making the interpretation of relationships to biogeochemical rates challenging. To overcome this issue, we quantitatively estimated the abundance of microorganisms by spiking in known amounts of internal DNA standards. Using a 3-year sample set of diverse microbial communities from the Western Antarctica Peninsula, we demonstrated that the internal standard method yielded community profiles and taxon cooccurrence patterns substantially different from those derived using relative abundances. We found that the method provided results consistent with the traditional CHEMTAX analysis of pigments and total bacterial counts by flow cytometry. Using the internal standard method, we also showed that chloroplast 16S rRNA gene data in microbial surveys can be used to estimate abundances of certain eukaryotic phototrophs such as cryptophytes and diatoms. In Phaeocystis , scatter in the 16S/18S rRNA gene ratio may be explained by physiological adaptation to environmental conditions. We conclude that the internal standard method, when applied to rRNA gene microbial community profiling, is quantitative and that its application will substantially improve our understanding of microbial ecosystems.},

abstract = {The current paradigm holds that cyanobacteria, which evolved oxygenic photosynthesis more than 2 billion years ago, are still the major light harvesters driving primary productivity in open oceans. Here we show that tiny unicellular eukaryotes belonging to the photosynthetic lineage of the Haptophyta are dramatically diverse and ecologically dominant in the planktonic photic realm. The use of Haptophyta-specific primers and PCR conditions adapted for GC-rich genomes circumvented biases inherent in classical genetic approaches to exploring environmental eukaryotic biodiversity and led to the discovery of hundreds of unique haptophyte taxa in 5 clone libraries from subpolar and subtropical oceanic waters. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this diversity emerged in Paleozoic oceans, thrived and diversified in the permanently oxygenated Mesozoic Panthalassa, and currently comprises thousands of ribotypic species, belonging primarily to low-abundance and ancient lineages of the "rare biosphere." This extreme biodiversity coincides with the pervasive presence in the photic zone of the world ocean of 19′- hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (19-Hex), an accessory photosynthetic pigment found exclusively in chloroplasts of haptophyte origin. Our new estimates of depth-integrated relative abundance of 19-Hex indicate that haptophytes dominate the chlorophyll a-normalized phytoplankton standing stock in modern oceans. Their ecologic and evolutionary success, arguably based on mixotrophy, may have significantly impacted the oceanic carbon pump. These results add to the growing evidence that the evolution of complex microbial eukaryotic cells is a critical force in the functioning of the biosphere.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

However, the extent to which the relative influences of ecological processes mediate the assembly of differentially sized soil organisms is still unknown. Here, we investigate the community assembly of differentially sized soil microorganisms and microfauna using a continental-scale sampling effort combined with a global-scale meta-analysis. Our results reveal a general relationship between organism body size and the stochastic-deterministic balance operating on community assembly. The smallest microorganisms (bacteria) are relatively more influenced by dispersal-based stochastic processes, while larger ones (fungi, protists and nematodes) are more structured by selection-based deterministic processes. This study elucidates a significant and consistent relationship between an organism life-history trait and how distinct ecological processes operate in mediating their respective community assemblages, thus providing a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting soil biodiversity.},

abstract = {The marine planktonic diatom order Thalassiosirales are used as climate proxies with reported characteristic temperate and Polar species. However, a systematic analysis of the genetic variability and species limits is lacking. Here, we combined molecular and morphological approaches to identify Thalassiosirales from 7 Beaufort Sea sea-ice samples and 27 water-column samples collected from across the Canadian Arctic at different times of the year and the Scotia Shelf, North Atlantic in spring. While many species were found in both oceanic regions, there were two distinct Thalassiosirales communities: the first from sea ice and ice-influenced water columns and the second Arctic late summer and North Atlantic spring communities. Thalassiosirales formed genetically coherent Boreal-Arctic meta-communities, inclusive of intra-specific variants. Genetic similarity between the Arctic and North Atlantic meta-communities would be reinforced by counter-clockwise dominant surface current systems. Local patterns of spatial and temporal distributions of planktonic thalassiosiroids were best explained by latitudinal gradients and phosphate and silicate concentrations, suggesting that climate-mediated changes in Arctic and North Atlantic hydrography could have a marked effect on species distribution. Our analysis also revealed a need for taxonomic revision of several species complexes reported from the region before they can be reliably used as bio-indicators.},

With the nascent Reagent Kit v3, Illumina MiSeq now has the ability to sequence the eukaryotic hyper-variable V4 region of the SSU-rDNA locus with paired-end reads. Using DNA collected from soils with analyses of strictly- and nearly identical amplicons, here we ask how the new Illumina MiSeq data compares with what we can obtain with Roche/454 GS FLX with regard to quantity and quality, presence and absence, and abundance perspectives. We show that there is an easy qualitative transition from the Roche/454 to the Illumina MiSeq platforms. The ease of this transition is more nuanced quantitatively for low-abundant amplicons, although estimates of abundances are known to also vary within platforms.},

abstract = {Amplicon read sequencing has revolutionized the field of microbial diversity studies. The technique has been developed for bacterial assemblages and has undergone rigorous testing with mock communities. However, due to the great complexity of eukaryotes and the numbers of different rDNA copies, analyzing eukaryotic diversity is more demanding than analyzing bacterial or mock communities, so studies are needed that test the methods of analyses on taxonomically diverse natural communities. In this study, we used 20 samples collected from the Baltic Sea ice, slush and under-ice water to investigate three program packages (UPARSE, mothur and QIIME) and 18 different bioinformatic strategies implemented in them. Our aim was to assess the impact of the initial steps of bioinformatic strategies on the results when analyzing natural eukaryotic communities. We found significant differences among the strategies in resulting read length, number of OTUs and estimates of diversity as well as clear differences in the taxonomic composition of communities. The differences arose mainly because of the variable number of chimeric reads that passed the pre-processing steps. Singleton removal and denoising substantially lowered the number of errors. Our study showed that the initial steps of the bioinformatic amplicon read processing strategies require careful consideration before applying them to eukaryotic communities.},

abstract = {Bacteria, fungi and green algae are common inhabitants of coral skeletons. Their diversity is poorly characterized because they are difficult to identify with microscopy or environmental sequencing, as common metabarcoding markers have low phylogenetic resolution and miss a large portion of the biodiversity. We used a cost-effective protocol and a combination of markers (tufA, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA and 23S rDNA) to characterize the microbiome of 132 coral skeleton samples. We identified a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, many never reported in corals before. We additionally investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the green algae—the most abundant eukaryotic member of this community, for which previous literature recognizes only a handful of endolithic species. We found more than 120 taxonomic units (near species level), including six family-level lineages mostly new to science. The results suggest that the existence of lineages with an endolithic lifestyle predates the existence of modern scleractinian corals by ca. 250my, and that this particular niche was independently invaded by over 20 lineages in green algae evolution. These results highlight the potential of the multi-marker approach to assist in species discovery and, when combined with a phylogenetic framework, clarify the evolutionary origins of host-microbiota associations. Corals harbour a diverse microbial community that is vital for their health and resilience 1,2 . The skeletons of stony corals are populated by endolithic (limestone-boring) bacteria, fungi and a conspicuous layer of green algae 3,4 . These organisms are protected from the external environment but endure very low levels of light and extreme daily fluctuations of pH and oxygen levels 5 . The endolithic habitat therefore contains a specialized microbial community, and very little is known about when or how many times the association between corals and these organisms has evolved. Endolithic algae constitute a major component of the endolithic microbiome in terms of abundance and eco-logical roles. They are the principal microbial agent of reef erosion 6,7},

abstract = {The ecosystem role of Arctic microbial communities is still largely unknown. Based on a time-series study at the IsA station (West Spitsbergen), the seasonality and contribution of pelagic protists to the vertical flux was investigated at 7 time points during 2011-2012. The hydrography of this high-Arctic fjord was evaluated to identify impacts on the community composition during the different seasons. Protists ({\textless}10 µm, {\textgreater}10 µm) were sampled at 4 depths from the water column and from short-time sediment traps, and investigated by 454 next generation sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal DNA. An advective event during winter, exchanging the cold and less saline water mass with warmer and saline Atlantic Water, was potentially responsible for an abrupt shift in the protist composition in March. Small cells ({\textless} 10 µm) contributed significantly to the vertical flux during autumn and winter, while larger bloom taxa (e.g. diatoms) predominated water and traps during spring. Parasitic species, such as MALV 1a and Chytriodinium sp. were also detected in the traps, possibly being transported along with their hosts. Vertical export of Arctic pelagic protists is not limited to the productive period; however the contribution of small taxa that are important contributors in this study seems to be seasonally influenced and may alter the flux efficiency. Molecular tools revealed new taxa contributing to the vertical export, but also identified new potential mechanisms exemplified by parasite-host induced transport spurring to increase attention onto parasitism when studying carbon cycles and vertical flux.},

The compositional changes throughout the year were assessed in relation to in situ fjord environmental conditions. Size fractionation analyses of chlorophyll a showed that the photosynthetic biomass was dominated by small cells ({\textless}10 $\mu$m) most of the year but that larger cells dominated during the spring and summer. The winter and early-spring communities were more diverse than the spring and summer/autumn communities. Dinophyceae were predominant throughout the year. The Arctic Micromonas ecotype was abundant mostly in the early-bloom and fall periods, whereas heterotrophs, such as marine stramenopiles (MASTs), Picozoa, and the parasitoid marine alveolates (MALVs), displayed higher relative abundance in the winter than in other seasons. Our results emphasize the extreme seasonality of Arctic microbial eukaryotic communities driven by the light regime and nutrient availability but point to the necessity of a thorough knowledge of hydrography for full understanding of their succession and variability.},

Water masses of a back-arc basin with hydrothermal activity provide a unique opportunity for studying the effects of dispersal and environmental selection on protist communities. In this study, we used metabarcoding to characterize protist communities in the Okinawa Trough, a back-arc spreading basin containing at least twenty-five active hydrothermal vent fields. Water was sampled from four depths at fourteen stations spanning the length of the Okinawa Trough, including three sites influenced by nearby hydrothermal vent sites. While significant differences in community structure reflecting water depth were present, protist communities were mostly homogeneous horizontally. Protist communities in the bottom waters affected by hydrothermal activity were significantly different from communities in other bottom waters, suggesting that environmental factors can be especially important in shaping community composition under specific conditions. Amplicon sequence variants that were enriched in hydrothermally influenced bottom waters largely derived from cosmopolitan protists that were present, but rare, in other near-bottom samples, thus highlighting the importance of the rare biosphere.},

abstract = {Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the predominant method to quantify microbial compositions and to discover novel lineages. However, traditional short amplicons often do not contain enough information to confidently resolve their phylogeny. Here we present a cost-effective protocol that amplifies a large part of the rRNA operon and sequences the amplicons with PacBio technology. We tested our method on a mock community and developed a read-curation pipeline that reduces the overall read error rate to 0.18{\%}. Applying our method on four environmental samples, we captured near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes. The method operated at moderately high-throughput (22286–37,850 raw ccs reads) and generated a large amount of putative novel archaeal 23S rRNA gene sequences compared to the archaeal SILVA database. These long amplicons allowed for higher resolution during taxonomic classification by means of long (∼1000 bp) 16S rRNA gene fragments and for substantially more confident phylogenies by means of combined near full-length 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences, compared to shorter traditional amplicons (250 bp of the 16S rRNA gene). We recommend our method to those who wish to cost-effectively and confidently estimate the phylogenetic diversity of prokaryotes in environmental samples at high throughput.},

Here we show that although all taxa undergo large, near daily fluctuations in abundance, microbial plankton are organized into clearly defined communities whose turnover is rapid and sharp. We analyze a time series of 93 consecutive days of coastal plankton using a technique that allows inference of communities as modular units of interacting taxa by determining positive and negative correlations at different temporal frequencies. This approach shows both coordinated population expansions that demarcate community boundaries and high frequency of positive and negative associations among populations within communities. Our analysis thus highlights that the environmental variability of the coastal ocean is mirrored in sharp transitions of defined but ephemeral communities of organisms.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms are caused by specific members of microbial communities. Understanding the dynamics of these events requires comparing the strategies developed by the problematic species to cope with environmental fluctuations to the ones developed by the other members of the community. During three consecutive years, the meta-transcriptome of micro-eukaryote communities was sequenced during blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum. The dataset was analyzed to investigate species specific gene expression dynamics. Major shifts in gene expression were explained by the succession of different species within the community. Although expression patterns were strongly correlated with fluctuation of the abiotic environment, and more specifically with nutrient concentration, transcripts specifically involved in nutrient uptake and metabolism did not display extensive changes in gene expression. Compared to the other members of the community, A. minutum displayed a very specific expression pattern, with lower expression of photosynthesis transcripts and central metabolism genes (TCA cycle, glucose metabolism, glycolysis{\ldots}) and contrasting expression pattern of ion transporters across environmental conditions. These results suggest the importance of mixotrophy, cell motility and cell-to-cell interactions during A. minutum blooms.},

abstract = {Information on recent photosynthetic biomass distribution and biogeography of Arctic marine pico-eukaryotes (0.2-3 $\mu$m) is needed to better understand consequences of environmental change for Arctic marine ecosystems. We analysed pico-eukaryote biomass and community composition in Fram Strait and large parts of the Central Arctic Ocean (Nansen Basin, Amundsen Basin) using chlorophyll a (Chl a) measurements, automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and 454-pyrosequencing. Samples were collected during summer 2012, the year with the most recent record sea ice minimum. Chl a concentrations were highest in eastern Fram Strait and pico-plankton accounted for 60-90{\%} of Chl a biomass during the observation period. ARISA-patterns and 454-pyrosequencing revealed that pico-eukaryote distribution is closely related to water mass distribution in the euphotic zone of the Arctic Ocean. Phaeocystaceae, Micromonas sp., Dinophyceae and Syndiniales constitute a high proportion of sequence reads, while sequence abundance of autotrophic Phaeocystaceae and mixotrophic Micromonas sp. was inversely correlated. Highest sequence abundances of Phaeocystaceae were observed in the warm Atlantic Waters in Fram Strait, while Micromonas sp. dominated the abundant biosphere in the arctic halocline. Our results are of particular interest considering existing hypotheses that environmental conditions in Nansen Basin might become more similar to the current conditions in Fram Strait. We propose that in response, biodiversity and biomass of pico-eukaryotes in Nansen Basin could resemble those currently observed in Fram Strait in the future. This would significantly alter biogeochemical cycles in a large part of the Central Arctic Ocean.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPE) are key components of primary production in marine and freshwater ecosystems. In contrast with those of marine environments, freshwater PPE groups have received little attention. In this work, we used flow cytometry cell sorting, microscopy and metabarcoding to investigate the composition of small photosynthetic eukaryote communities from six eutrophic shallow lakes in South America, Argentina. We compared the total molecular diversity obtained from PPE sorted populations as well as from filtered total plankton samples (FTP). Most reads obtained from sorted populations belonged to the classes: Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae. We retrieved sequences from non-photosynthetic groups, such as Chytridiomycetes and Ichthyosporea which contain a number of described parasites, indicating that these organisms were probably in association with the autotrophic cells sorted. Dominant groups among sorted PPEs were poorly represented in FTP and their richness was on average lower than in the sorted samples. A significant number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were exclusively found in sorting samples, emphasizing that sequences from FTP underestimate the diversity of PPE. Moreover, 22{\%} of the OTUs found among the dominant groups had a low similarity ({\textless}95{\%}) with reported sequences in public databases, demonstrating a high potential for novel diversity in these lakes.},

abstract = {Transitional waters are subject to a high degree of variability in space and time. In this study, protist plankton communities of the Lagoon of Venice were compared among four sites characterised by different environmental conditions with a metabarcoding approach. High throughput sequencing (HTS) of the V4-18S rDNA fragment in 32 samples collected on four dates, from April 2016 to February 2017, produced 1,137,113 reads, which were grouped into 4,058 OTUs at 97{\%} similarity. Bacillariophyta and Ciliophora were the most abundant groups in the entire dataset in terms of read number (27.6{\%} and 16.6{\%}, respectively), followed by Dinophyta (10.9{\%}), Cryptophyceae (9.7{\%}), and Syndiniales (6.1{\%}). The contribution of protist groups markedly varied across the seasons, but spatial differences were also recorded in the lagoon. In April, a higher contribution of Bacillariophyta characterized St1 and 5 (68.0{\%} and 61.1{\%}), whereas Sts2 and 3 showed a higher percentage of Ciliophora (18.6 and 23.4{\%}, respectively) and dinoflagellates (10.3 and 7.7{\%}). In July, diatom blooms occurred at Sts1, 2 and 3, with some differences in the dominant species. At St2 Dinophyta reached the highest contribution of the whole sampling period in the area (30.6{\%}), while St5 was quite distinct, with a low contribution of diatoms and a dominance of Ciliophora (34.0{\%}) and Trebouxiophyceae (36.4{\%}). All the stations in November were characterized by relatively high abundance of Ciliophora (21.4-51.9{\%}). In February, diatom contribution was relevant only at St5 (29.3{\%}), Teleaulax acuta peaked at St3 (ca. 36{\%}), Syndiniales at St2 (38.8{\%}) and Dictyochophyceae at St1 (24.2{\%}). The $\alpha$-diversity indexes (observed OTUs, Shannon and Pielou evenness) showed a high variability over space and time. Overall, diversity and community composition were rather similar between the intermediate and deeper Sts2 and 3 on all sampling dates whereas they at time differed between the landward and shallow Sts1 and 5. While the most marked differences occurred over the temporal scale, the depth of the station and the relatedness with the external marine coastal environment appear to play a major role in the spatial distribution of protist communities within the lagoon.},

abstract = {Symbiotic partnerships between heterotrophic hosts and intracellular microalgae are common in tropical and subtropical oligotrophic waters of benthic and pelagic marine habitats. The iconic example is the photosynthetic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium that establishes mutualistic symbioses with a wide diversity of benthic hosts, sustaining highly biodiverse reef ecosystems worldwide. Paradoxically, although various species of photosynthetic dinoflagellates are prevalent eukaryotic symbionts in pelagic waters, Symbiodinium has not yet been reported in symbiosis within oceanic plankton, despite its high propensity for the symbiotic lifestyle. Here we report a new pelagic photosymbiosis between a calcifying ciliate host and the microalga Symbiodinium in surface ocean waters. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy, together with an 18S rDNA-based phylogeny, showed that the host is a new ciliate species closely related to Tiarina fusus (Colepidae). Phylogenetic analyses of the endosymbionts based on the 28S rDNA gene revealed multiple novel closely related Symbiodinium clade A genotypes. A haplotype network using the high-resolution internal transcribed spacer-2 marker showed that these genotypes form eight divergent, biogeographically structured, subclade types that do not seem to associate with any benthic hosts. Ecological analyses using the Tara Oceans metabarcoding data set (V9 region of the 18S rDNA) and contextual oceanographic parameters showed a global distribution of the symbiotic partnership in nutrient-poor surface waters. The discovery of the symbiotic life of Symbiodinium in the open ocean provides new insights into the ecology and evolution of this pivotal microalga and raises new hypotheses about coastal pelagic connectivity.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of ocean biomes has revealed vast eukaryotic microbial diversity, a significant proportion of which remains uncharacterized. Here we use a temporal approach to understanding eukaryotic diversity at the Scripps Pier, La Jolla, California, USA, via high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, the abundances of both Synechococcus and Synechococcus grazers, and traditional oceanographic parameters. We also exploit our ability to track operational taxonomic units (OTUs) temporally to evaluate the ability of 18S sequence-based OTU assignments to meaningfully reflect ecological dynamics. The eukaryotic community is highly dynamic in terms of both species richness and composition, although proportional representation of higher-order taxa remains fairly consistent over time. Synechococcus abundance fluctuates throughout the year. OTUs unique to dates of Synechococcus blooms and crashes or enriched in Synechococcus addition incubation experiments suggest that the prasinophyte Tetraselmis sp. and Gymnodinium-like dinoflagellates are likely Synechococcus grazers under certain conditions, and may play an important role in their population fluctuations.},

abstract = {Numerous ecological processes, such as bacteriophage infection and phytoplankton–bacterial interactions, often occur via strain-specific mechanisms. Therefore, studying the causes of microbial dynamics should benefit from highly resolving taxonomic characterizations. We sampled daily to weekly over 5 months following a phytoplankton bloom off Southern California and examined the extent of microdiversity, that is, significant variation within 99{\%} sequence similarity clusters, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), of bacteria, archaea, phytoplankton chloroplasts (all via 16S or intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences) and T4-like-myoviruses (via g23 major capsid protein gene sequence). The extent of microdiversity varied between genes (ITS most, g23 least) and only temporally common taxa were highly microdiverse. Overall, 60{\%} of taxa exhibited microdiversity; 59{\%} of these had subtypes that changed significantly as a proportion of the parent taxon, indicating ecologically distinct taxa. Pairwise correlations between prokaryotes and myoviruses or phytoplank- ton (for example, highly microdiverse Chrysochromulina sp.) improved when using single-base variants. Correlations between myoviruses and SAR11 increased in number (172 vs 9, Spear- man40.65) and became stronger (0.61 vs 0.58, t-test: Po0.001) when using SAR11 ITS single-base variants vsOTUs. Whole-community correlation between SAR11 andmyoviruses was much improved when using ITS single-base variants vs OTUs, with Mantel rho=0.49 vs 0.27; these results are consistent with strain-specific interactions. Mantel correlations suggested 41 $\mu$m (attached/large) prokaryotes are a major myovirus source. Consideration of microdiversity improved observation of apparent host and virus networks, and provided insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors influencing the success of lineages, with important implications to ecosystem resilience and microbial and microbial function.},

abstract = {Protists are ubiquitous in soil, where they are key contributors to nutrient cycling and energy transfer. However, protists have received far less attention than other components of the soil microbiome. We used amplicon sequencing of soils from 180 locations across six continents to investigate the ecological preferences of protists and their functional contributions to belowground systems. We complemented these analyses with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 46 soils to validate the identities of the more abundant protist lineages. We found that most soils are dominated by consumers, although parasites and phototrophs are particularly abundant in tropical and arid ecosystems, respectively. The best predictors of protist composition (primarily annual precipitation) are fundamentally distinct from those shaping bacterial and archaeal communities (namely, soil pH). Some protists and bacteria co-occur globally, highlighting the potential importance of these largely undescribed belowground interactions. Together, this study allowed us to identify the most abundant and ubiquitous protists living in soil, with our work providing a cross-ecosystem perspective on the factors structuring soil protist communities and their likely contributions to soil functioning.},

abstract = {Molecular surveys are revealing diverse eukaryotic assemblages in oxygen-limited ocean waters. These communities may play pivotal ecological roles through autotrophy, feeding, and a wide range of symbiotic associations with prokaryotes. We used 18S rRNA gene sequencing to provide the first snapshot of pelagic microeukaryotic community structure in two cellular size fractions (0.2-1.6 $\mu$m, {\textgreater} 1.6 $\mu$m) from seven depths through the anoxic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off northern Chile. Sequencing of {\textgreater} 154,000 amplicons revealed contrasting patterns of phylogenetic diversity across size fractions and depths. Protist and total eukaryote diversity in the {\textgreater} 1.6 $\mu$m fraction peaked at the chlorophyll maximum in the upper photic zone before declining by {\~{}}50{\%} in the OMZ. In contrast, diversity in the 0.2-1.6 $\mu$m fraction, though also elevated in the upper photic zone, increased four-fold from the lower oxycline to a maximum at the anoxic OMZ core. Dinoflagellates of the Dinophyceae and endosymbiotic Syndiniales clades dominated the protist assemblage at all depths ({\~{}}40-70{\%} of sequences). Other protist groups varied with depth, with the anoxic zone community of the larger size fraction enriched in euglenozoan flagellates and acantharean radiolarians (up to 18 and 40{\%} of all sequences, respectively). The OMZ 0.2-1.6 $\mu$m fraction was dominated (11-99{\%}) by Syndiniales, which exhibited depth-specific variation in composition and total richness despite uniform oxygen conditions. Metazoan sequences, though confined primarily to the 1.6 $\mu$m fraction above the OMZ, were also detected within the anoxic zone where groups such as copepods increased in abundance relative to the oxycline and upper OMZ. These data, compared to those from other low-oxygen sites, reveal variation in OMZ microeukaryote composition, helping to identify clades with potential adaptations to oxygen-depletion.},

abstract = {Coral reefs harbor the most diverse assemblages in the ocean, however, a large proportion of the diversity is cryptic and, therefore, undetected by standard visual census techniques. Cryptic and exposed communities differ considerably in species composition and ecological function. This study compares three different coral reef assessment protocols: i) visual benthic reef surveys: ii) visual census of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) plates; and iii) metabarcoding techniques of the ARMS (including sessile, 106-500 $\mu$m and 500-2000 $\mu$m size fractions), that target the cryptic and exposed communities of three reefs in the central Red Sea. Visual census showed a dominance of Cnidaria (Anthozoa) and Rhodophyta on the reef substrate, while Porifera, Bryozoa and Rhodophyta were the most abundant groups on the ARMS plates. Metabarcoding, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, significantly increased estimates of the species diversity (p {\textless} 0.001); revealing that Annelida were generally the dominant phyla (in terms of reads) of all fractions and reefs. Furthermore, metabarcoding detected microbial eukaryotic groups such as Syndiniophyceae, Mamiellophyceae and Bacillariophyceae as relevant components of the sessile fraction. ANOSIM analysis showed that the three reef sites showed no differences based on the visual census data. Metabarcoding showed a higher sensitivity for identifying differences between reef communities at smaller geographic scales than standard visual census techniques as significant differences in the assemblages were observed amongst the reefs. Comparison of the techniques showed no similar patterns for the visual techniques while the metabarcoding of the ARMS showed similar patterns amongst fractions. Establishing ARMS as a standard tool in reef monitoring will not only advance our understanding of local processes and ecological community response to environmental changes, as different faunal components will provide complementary information but also improve the estimates of biodiversity in coral reef benthic communities. This study lays the foundations for further studies looking at integrating traditional reef survey methodologies with complementary approaches, such as metabarcoding, which investigate other components of the reef community.},

abstract = {The semi-enclosed nature of the Red Sea (20.2°N–38.5°N) makes it a natural laboratory to study the influence of environmental gradients on microbial communities. This study investigates the composition and structure of microbial prokaryotes and eukaryotes using molecular methods, targeting ribosomal RNA genes across different regions and seasons. The interaction between spatial and temporal scales results in different scenarios of turbulence and nutrient conditions allowing for testing of ecological theory that categorizes the response of the plankton community to these variations. The prokaryotic reads are mainly comprised of Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria (Alpha and Gamma), with eukaryotic reads dominated by Dinophyceae and Syndiniophyceae. Periodic increases in the proportion of Mamiellophyceae and Bacillariophyceae reads were associated with alterations in the physical oceanography leading to nutrient increases either through the influx of Gulf of Aden Intermediate Water (south in the fall) or through water column mixing processes (north in the spring). We observed that in general dissimilarity amongst microbial communities increased when nutrient concentrations were higher, whereas richness (observed OTUs) was higher in scenarios of higher turbulence. Maximum abundance models showed the differential responses of dominant taxa to temperature giving an indication how taxa will respond as waters become warmer and more oligotrophic.},

abstract = {Phylogenetically diverse pico- (cells {\textless}2 µm diameter) and nanoplanktonic (2–20 µm) microbial eukaryotes are ubiquitous in coastal ecosystems; however, there is little understanding of the intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (abiotic) factors that influence species composition in these communities. We investigated the microbial eukaryotes in the Havre-aux-Maisons Lagoon (Magdalen Islands, Gulf of St. Lawrence), which lacks riverine inputs and has little exchange with the surrounding gulf. We hypothesized that intrinsic successional processes and nutrient drawdown in the lagoon would lead to a decrease in average cell size over the summer. Samples for nutrients, cell concentrations from flow cytometry (FCM), and taxonomic identity using high throughput amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene were collected on 10 occasions between June and October 2009 and analysed in the context of physical and climatological data. Ratios of pico- to nanophytoplankton indicated no decline in average cell size over the summer, with picophytoplankton concentrations more variable. The microbial eukaryotic communities formed 3 major clusters based on phylogeny and UniFrac analysis. Taxonomically, dinoflagellates were dominant in the largest cluster, while picophytoplankton and nanoflagellates dominated the 2 other clusters. The concentrations of eukaryotic picophytoplankton increased in early summer, but decreased following periods with lower average wind speeds and increased following higher average winds. During periods with lower average wind speeds, dinoflagellates dominated. The clear impact of wind was consistent with climatological events indirectly influencing biotic interactions and picophytoplankton species composition.},

abstract = {The sequestration of carbon in the deep ocean relies on the export of sinking particulate organic matter (POM) originating in the surface waters and its attenuation by organisms that reprocess and repackage it. Despite decades of research, predicting the variability of POM to the deep ocean remains difficult as there is still a gap in the knowledge as to which and how organisms control or influence POM export. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate the community in sinking particulates collected over 9-months (November 2016–July 2017) at Station M, located within the California Current ecosystem. Particle-associated communities were collected in sediment traps (3900 m and 3950 m), in aggregates that settled on the sea floor (4000 m), and in seawater from the overlying water column. For a majority of the deployment, particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes were within the Station M long-term time series mean ± $\sigma$ (8.3 ± 7.9 mg C m−2 d−1). In late June, a high flux event ({\textgreater}long-term POC mean+2$\sigma$) was captured, accounting for 44{\%} of the POC collected during the study. The rRNA genes within the sinking particles indicated highly variable eukaryal communities over time, including the export of oligotrophic autotrophs likely by various metazoan taxa during winter, the sporadic and dominant presence of diverse radiolarian orders, and the important role of coastal diatoms during seasonal increases in POC flux. Specifically, the onset of the high POC flux event in June was attributed to the export of a single coastal diatom species. A coincident increase in the relative abundance of metazoan sequences suggests that zooplankton grazing on the diatom community played a role in rapid transport of large quantities of POC to the deep sea. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene community supported the presence of highly processed POM during winter due to the high relative abundance of deep sea Gammaproteobacteria, that transitioned to fresher, more labile POM with the arrival of a diatom bloom community. These observations support long standing paradigms of particulate export to the deep sea, including its origin and mechanisms of export mediated by a diverse community of organisms, and implicate rapidly exported diatom blooms as at least one source of the increasingly frequent episodic flux events that account for most POC sequestered in the deep ocean at Station M.},

abstract = {Marine microbes along with microeukaryotes are key regulators of oceanic biogeochemical pathways. Here we present a high-resolution (every 0.5° of latitude) dataset describing microbial pro- and eukaryotic richness in the surface and just below the thermocline along a 7,000-km transect from 66°S at the Antarctic ice edge to the equator in the South Pacific Ocean. The transect, conducted in austral winter, covered key oceanographic features including crossing of the polar front (PF), the subtropical front (STF), and the equatorial upwelling region. Our data indicate that temperature does not determine patterns of marine microbial richness, complementing the global model data from Ladau et al. [Ladau J, et al. (2013) ISME J 7:1669–1677]. Rather, NH 4 + , nanophytoplankton, and primary productivity were the main drivers for archaeal and bacterial richness. Eukaryote richness was highest in the least-productive ocean region, the tropical oligotrophic province. We also observed a unique diversity pattern in the South Pacific Ocean: a regional increase in archaeal and bacterial diversity between 10°S and the equator. Rapoport's rule describes the tendency for the latitudinal ranges of species to increase with latitude. Our data showed that the mean latitudinal ranges of archaea and bacteria decreased with latitude. We show that permanent oceanographic features, such as the STF and the equatorial upwelling, can have a significant influence on both alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of pro- and eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Oceanic physics at fine scale; e.g. eddies, fronts, filaments; are notoriously difficult to sample. However, an increasing number of theoretical approaches hypothesize that these processes affect phytoplankton diversity which have cascading effects on regional ecosystems. In 2015, we targeted the Iroise Sea (France) and evidenced the setting up of the Ushant tidal front from the beginning of spring to late summer. Seawater samples were taken during three sampling cruises and DNA-barcoding allowed us to investigate patterns of eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity across this front. First focusing on patterns of taxonomic richness, we evidenced that the front harbored a hotspot of eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity sustained throughout summer. We then detail the ecological processes leading to the formation of this hotspot by studying shifts in community composition across the Iroise Sea. Physical mixing mingled the communities surrounding the front, allowing the formation of a local ecotone, but it was cycles of disturbances and nutrient inputs over the front that allowed a decrease in competitive exclusion, which maintained a higher diversity of rare phytoplankton taxa. These processes did not select a specific ecological strategy as inferred by a trait approach coupled to our taxonomic approach. Instead the front favored higher richness within widespread strategies, resulting in functional redundancy. We detail how fine-scale ocean physics affect phytoplankton diversity and suppose that this interplay is a major control on regional ecosystems.},

abstract = {In summer 2012, Arctic sea ice declined to a record minimum and, as a consequence of the melting, large amounts of aggregated ice-algae sank to the seafloor at more than 4000 m depth. In this study, we assessed the composition, turnover and connectivity of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities across Arctic habitats from sea ice, algal aggregates and surface waters to the seafloor. Eukaryotic communities were dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates and other alveolates in all samples, and showed highest richness and diversity in sea-ice habitats ({\~{}}400-500 OTUs). Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria were the predominant bacterial classes across all investigated Arctic habitats. Bacterial community richness and diversity peaked in deep-sea samples ({\~{}}1700 OTUs). Algal aggregate-associated bacterial communities were mainly recruited from the sea-ice community, and were transported to the seafloor with the sinking ice algae. The algal deposits at the seafloor had a unique community structure, with some shared sequences with both the original sea-ice community (22{\%} OTU overlap), as well as with the deep-sea sediment community (17{\%} OTU overlap). We conclude that ice-algal aggregate export does not only affect carbon export from the surface to the seafloor, but may change microbial community composition in central Arctic habitats with potential effects for benthic ecosystem functioning in the future.},

abstract = {Variation in light and temperature can influence the genetic diversity and structure of marine plankton communities. While open-ocean plankton communities receive much scientific attention, little is known about how environmental variation affects plankton communities on tropical coral reefs. Here, we characterize eukaryotic plankton communities on coral reefs across the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panam{\'{a}}. Temperature loggers were deployed, and midday light levels were measured to quantify environmental differences across reefs at four inshore and four offshore sites (Inshore = Punta Donato, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) Point, Cristobal, Punta Laurel and Offshore = Drago Mar, Bastimentos North, Bastimentos South, and Cayo de Agua). Triplicate vertical plankton tows were collected midday, and high-throughput 18S ribosomal DNA metabarcoding was leveraged to investigate the relationship between eukaryotic plankton community structure and inshore/offshore reef environments. Plankton communities from STRI Point were additionally characterized in the morning ({\~{}} 08:00), midday ({\~{}} 12:00), and late-day ({\~{}} 16:00) to quantify temporal variation within a single site. We found that inshore reefs experienced higher average seawater temperatures, while offshore sites offered higher light levels, presumably associated with reduced water turbidity on reefs further from shore. These significant environmental differences between inshore and offshore reefs corresponded with overall plankton community differences. We also found that temporal variation played a structuring role within these plankton communities, and conclude that time of community sampling is an important consideration for future studies. Follow-up studies focusing on more intensive sampling efforts across space and time, coupled with techniques that can detect more subtle genetic differences between and within communities will more fully capture plankton dynamics in this region and beyond.},

abstract = {Sponge-associated microbial communities include members from the three domains of life. In the case of bacteria, they are diverse, host specific and different from the surrounding seawater. However, little is known about the diversity and specificity of Eukarya and Archaea living in association with marine sponges. This knowledge gap is even greater regarding sponges from regions other than temperate and tropical environments. In Antarctica, marine sponges are abundant and important members of the benthos, structuring the Antarctic marine ecosystem. In this study, we used high throughput ribosomal gene sequencing to investigate the three-domain diversity and community composition from eight different Antarctic sponges. Taxonomic identification reveals that they belong to families Acarnidae, Chalinidae, Hymedesmiidae, Hymeniacidonidae, Leucettidae, Microcionidae, and Myxillidae. Our study indicates that there are different diversity and similarity patterns between bacterial/archaeal and eukaryote microbial symbionts from these Antarctic marine sponges, indicating inherent differences in how organisms from different domains establish symbiotic relationships. In general, when considering diversity indices and number of phyla detected, sponge-associated communities are more diverse than the planktonic communities. We conclude that three-domain microbial communities from Antarctic sponges are different from surrounding planktonic communities, expanding previous observations for Bacteria and including the Antarctic environment. Furthermore, we reveal differences in the composition of the sponge associated bacterial assemblages between Antarctic and tropical-temperate environments and the presence of a highly complex microbial eukaryote community, suggesting a particular signature for Antarctic sponges, different to that reported from other ecosystems.},

abstract = {Diatoms generate nearly half of marine primary production and are comprised of a diverse array of species that are often morphologically cryptic or difficult to identify using light microscopy. Here, species composition and realized thermal niches of species in the diatom genus Thalassiosira were examined at the site of the Narragansett Bay (NBay) Long-Term Plankton Time Series using a combination of light microscopy (LM), high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 18S rDNA V4 region and historical records. Thalassiosira species were identified over 6 years using a combination of LM and DNA sequences. Sixteen Thalassiosira taxa were identified using HTS: nine were newly identified in NBay. Several newly identified species have small cell diameters and are difficult to identify using LM. However, they appeared frequently and thus may play a significant ecological role in NBay, particularly since their realized niches suggest they are eurythermal and able to tolerate the {\textgreater}25 °C temperature range of NBay. Four distinct species assemblages that grouped by season were best explained by surface water temperature. When compared to historical records, we found that the cold-water species Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii has decreased in persistence over time, suggesting that increasing surface water temperature has influenced the ecology of phytoplankton in NBay.},

abstract = {The structure of microbial communities, microalgae, heterotrophic protozoa and fungi contributes to characterize food webs and productivity and, from an anthropogenic point of view, the qualitative characteristics of water bodies. Traditionally, in freshwater environments many investigations have been directed to the study of pelagic microalgae (“phytoplankton”) and periphyton (i.e., photosynthetic and mixotrophic protists) through the use of light microscopy (LM). While the number of studies on bacterioplankton communities have shown a substantial increase after the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches, the study of the composition, structure, and spatio-temporal patterns of microbial eukaryotes in freshwater environments was much less widespread. Moreover, the understanding of the correspondence between the relative phytoplankton abundances estimated by HTS and LM is still incomplete. Taking into account these limitations, this study examined the biodiversity and seasonality of the community of eukaryotic microplankton in the epilimnetic layer of a large and deep perialpine lake (Lake Garda) using HTS. The analyses were carried out at monthly frequency during 2014 and 2015. The results highlighted the existence of a rich and well diversified community and the presence of numerous phytoplankton taxa that were never identified by LM in previous investigations. Furthermore, the relative abundances of phytoplankton estimated by HTS and LM showed a significant relationship at different taxonomic ranks. In the 2 years of investigation, the temporal development of the whole micro-eukaryotic community showed a clear non-random and comparable distribution pattern, with the main taxonomic groups coherently distributed in the individual seasons. In perspective, the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of HTS approaches in assessing biodiversity and the relative importance of the main protist groups along environmental gradients, including those caused by anthropogenic impacts (e.g., eutrophication and climate change).},

abstract = {In 1983, Hasle and colleagues removed cymatosiroid diatoms from the pennates, and erected a new centric diatom family, the Cymatosiraceae, mainly to accommodate for their newly discovered mode of sexual reproduction. The new family consisted of two subfamilies differing in frustule structure. The family was later elevated to the rank of Order Cymatosirales Round and Crawford. We revisited intra-ordinal relationships within Cymatosirales using combined genetic (DNA sequences), morphological (valve and frustule structure), and reproductive (auxospore type) characters. In total, 36 cymatosiroid strains from 19 species representing 13 genera (80{\%} of the total number of extant genera; nine of them represented by their generitypes) were used in this study. Instead of only the commonly used loci (18S rRNA and plastidal genes) to infer diatom phylogeny, we developed a consensus secondary structure model of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) for this order and applied it to aid in sequence alignments for ITS2. This improved the alignment and thus the robustness of the phylogenetic framework. The compensatory base changes (CBCs) found in ITS2 secondary structures were mapped onto the multi-gene (18S rRNA + ITS2 + rbcL) phylogenetic tree topology. In all these trees, all species grouped into two morphologically and genetically distinct clades. Each clade was supported by multiple CBCs, as did all the clades representing genera. However, these clades did not correspond to the previously established subfamilies. Consequently, we amend the Order Cymatosirales and family Cymatosiraceae, and propose a new family, the Leyanellaceae. The structure of the auxospore was an additional synapomorphic character for Cymatosirales. Overall, we demonstrate a novel approach to study diatom phylogeny across a broader taxonomic range using ITS2 secondary structural information. Our results suggest that this approach might be useful in establishing higher taxonomic relationships in other groups of diatoms.},

abstract = {Marine microbial eukaryotes play crucial roles in water-column ecosystems; however, there are regional gaps in the investigation of natural microbial eukaryote communities, and uncertainties concerning their distribution persevere. This study combined 18S rRNA metabarcoding, biomass measurements and statistical analyses of multiple environmental variables to examine the distribution of planktonic microbial eukaryotes at different sites and water layers in the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Western Levantine Basin). Our results showed that microbial eukaryotic communities were structured by depth. In surface waters, different sites shared high percentages of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), but this was not the case for deep-sea communities (≥1000 m). Plankton biomass was significantly different among sites, implying that communities of a similar composition may not support the same activity or population size. The deep-sea communities showed high percentages of unassigned MOTUs, highlighting the sparsity of the existing information on deep-sea plankton eukaryotes. Water temperature and dissolved organic matter significantly affected community distribution. Micro-eukaryotic distribution was additionally affected by the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio and viral abundance, while nano- and pico-communities were affected by zooplankton. The present study explores microbial plankton eukaryotes in their natural oligotrophic environment and highlights that, even within restricted oceanic areas, marine plankton may follow distribution patterns that are largely controlled by environmental variables.},

abstract = {Our knowledge on microbial biogeography depends on the way we define and study diversity. In contrast to most microbes, some protist lineages have conspicuous structures that allow comparisons of diversity concepts and measures-those based on molecules and those based on morphology. We analyzed a group of shell-bearing planktonic ciliates, the tintinnids, in a coast-to-ocean gradient using high-throughput sequencing and microscopy. First, we compared molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and morphospecies in terms of assemblage composition, distribution and relationships with the environment. OTUs revealed potentially novel and rare taxa, while morphospecies showed clearer correlations with environmental factors, and both approaches coincided in supporting a coastal versus oceanic pattern. Second, we explored which processes influence assembly across the environmental gradient examined. Assemblage fluctuations were associated with significant distance-decay and changes in morphospecies size and prey proxies, thus suggesting niche partitioning as a key structuring mechanism. Our conclusion is that molecules and morphologies generally agreed, but they provided complementary data, the first revealing hidden diversity, and the latter making better connections between distribution patterns and ecological processes. This highlights the importance of linking genotypes and phenotypes (using multidisciplinary analyses and/or reliable databases of barcoded species), to understand the diversity, biogeography and ecological roles of microbes.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 5 February 2016; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.224.},

abstract = {Microbial eukaryotes play important roles in aquatic ecosystem functioning. Unravelling their distribution patterns and biogeography provides important baseline information to infer the underlying mechanisms that regulate the biodiversity and complexity of ecosystems. We studied the distribution patterns and factors driving diversity gradients in microeukaryote communities (total, abundant, uncommon and rare community composition) along a latitudinal gradient of lakes distributed from Argentinean Patagonia to Maritime Antarctica using both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and high-throughput sequencing (IlluminaHiSeq). DGGE and abundant Illumina operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed both decreasing richness with latitude and significant differences between Patagonian and Antarctic lakes communities. In contrast, total richness did not change significantly across the latitudinal gradient, although evenness and diversity indices were significantly higher in Patagonian lakes. Beta-diversity was characterized by a high species turnover, influenced by both environmental and geographical descriptors, although this pattern faded in the rare community. Our results suggest the co-existence of a ‘core biosphere' containing reduced number of abundant/dominant OTUs on which classical ecological rules apply, together with a much larger seedbank of rare OTUs driven by stochastic and reduced dispersal processes. These findings shed new light on the biogeographical patterns and forces structuring inland microeukaryote composition across broad spatial scales. Keywords:},

abstract = {Aim: Trends in spatial patterns of diversity in macroscopic organisms can be well predicted from correlative models, using topo-climatic variables for plants and animals allowing inference over large scales. By contrast, diversity in soil microorganisms is generally considered as mostly driven by edaphic variables and, therefore, difficult to extrapolate on a large spatial scale based on predictive models. Here, we compared the power of topo-climatic versus edaphic variables for predicting the diversity of various soil protist groups at the regional scale. Location: Swiss western Alps. Taxa: Full protist community and nine clades belonging respectively to three functional groups: parasites (Apicomplexa, Peronosporomycetes and Phytomyxea), phagotrophs (Sarcomonadea, Tubulinea and Spirotrichea) and phototrophs (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae and Diatomeae). Methods: We extracted soil DNA from 178 sites along a wide range of elevations with a random-stratified sampling design. We defined protist Operational Taxonomic Units assemblages by metabarcoding of the V4 region of the rRNA small subunit gene. We assessed and modelled the diversity (Shannon index) patterns of all above-mentioned taxonomic groups based on topo-climatic (topography, slope southness, slope steepness and average summer temperature) and edaphic (soil temperature, relative humidity, pH, electroconductivity, phosphorus percentage, carbon/nitrogen, loss on ignition and shale percentage) variables in Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Results: The respective significance of topo-climatic and edaphic variables varied among taxonomic and—to a certain extent—functional groups: while many variables explained significantly the diversity of the three phototrophs this was less the case for the three parasites. Topo-climatic variables had a better predictive power than edaphic variables, yet predictive power varied among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions: Topo-climatic variables (particularly slope steepness and summer temperature if we consider their significance in the GAMs) were, on average, better predictors of protist diversity at the landscape scale than edaphic variables. However, the predictive power of these variables on diversity differed considerably among taxonomic groups; such relationships may be due to direct and/or indirect (e.g. biotic) influences (like with parasitic taxa, where low predictive power is most likely explained by the absence of information on the hosts' distribution). Future prospects include using such spatial models to predict hotspots of diversity and disease outbreaks.},

The seasonal diversity and composition of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) in Lake Poyang were investigated from flow-cytometry-sorted samples using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Flow cytometric counting indicated that PPEs accounted for 97{\%} of the total picophytoplankton abundance in spring, reaching a maximum value of 6.30 × 104 cells mL-1. PPEs in Lake Poyang showed lower diversity than those in other investigated lakes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and were dominated by one OTU (66.29{\%}) affiliated with Mychonastes (Chlorophyceae). Other minor classes of PPEs were found to be sporadically abundant in specific seasons, i.e. Chrysophyceae prevailed in spring and summer, while Eustigmatophyceae was mainly present in winter. This study reports coccal green algae of Mychonastes in Lake Poyang; additionally, these algae are reportedly representative of the prominent plankton in this river-connected lake ecosystem but are often overlooked due to their lack of morphological features. Finally, the sequencing results from the sorted samples of Lake Poyang revealed that the proportion of PPEs was quite low, with an average of 36{\%} of total reads. Many OTUs belonging to heterotrophic picoeukaryotes were also identified in the sorted samples, most of which were affiliated with terrestrial fungi, including Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The spores of these fungi can disperse in the aquatic environment during the flood seasons, yet their effect on PPEs is still unclear.},

abstract = {Although inland water bodies are more heterogeneous and sensitive to environmental variation than oceans, the diversity of small protists in these ecosystems is much less well known. Some molecular surveys of lakes exist, but little information is available from smaller, shallower and often ephemeral freshwater systems, despite their global distribution and ecological importance. We carried out a comparative study based on massive pyrosequencing of amplified 18S rRNA gene fragments of protists in the 0.2–5 $\mu$m size range in one brook and four shallow ponds located in the Natural Regional Park of the Chevreuse Valley, France. Our study revealed a wide diversity of small protists, with 812 stringently defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the recognized eukaryotic supergroups (SAR − Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria − Archaeplastida, Excavata, Amoebozoa, Opisthokonta) and to groups of unresolved phylogenetic position (Cryptophyta, Haptophyta, Centrohelida, Katablepharida, Telonemida, Apusozoa). Some OTUs represented deep-branching lineages (Cryptomycota, Aphelida, Colpodellida, Tremulida, clade-10 Cercozoa, HAP-1 Haptophyta). We identified several lineages previously thought to be marine including, in addition to MAST-2 and MAST-12, already detected in freshwater, MAST-3 and possibly MAST-6. Protist community structures were different in the five ecosystems. These differences did not correlate with geographical distances, but seemed to be influenced by environmental parameters.},

abstract = {The cosmopolitan haptophyte Phaeocystis is recognized as a key contributor to marine biogeochemical cycling and important primary producer within polar marine environments. Yet, little is known about its solitary, non-colonial cell stages or its distribution during the colder, low-productivity seasons. We examined the biogeography of Phaeocystis along a high-resolution (0.5-degree latitudinal interval) transect from the Antarctic ice-edge to the equator of the South Pacific, in the austral autumn-winter. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequences with single nucleotide variable (zero-radius) operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) allowed us to explore the possibility of strain-level variation. From water samples within the upper water column, we show the presence of an abundant Phaeocystis assemblage that persisted during the colder months, contributing up to 9{\%} of the microbial eukaryote community at high latitudes. The biogeography of Phaeocystis was strongly shaped by oceanographic boundaries, most prominently the polar and subantarctic fronts. Marked changes in dominant Phaeocystis antarctica zOTUs between different frontal zones support the concept that ecotypes may exist within the Phaeocystis assemblage. Our findings also show that the Phaeocystis assemblage did not abide by the classical latitudinal diversity gradient of increasing richness from the poles to the tropics; richness peaked at 30 • S and declined to a minimum at 5 • S. Another surprise was that P. globosa and P. cordata, previously thought to be restricted to the northern hemisphere, were detected at moderate abundances within the Southern Ocean. Our results emphasize the importance of oceanographic processes in shaping the biogeography of Phaeocystis and highlights the importance of genomics-based exploration of Phaeocystis, which have found the assemblage to be more complex than previously understood. The high winter relative abundance of the Phaeocystis assemblage suggests it could be involved in more complex ecological interactions during the less productive seasons, which should be considered in future studies to better understand the ecological role and strategies of this keystone species.},

abstract = {Monitoring changes in eukaryotic microbial communities is critical for understanding ecosystem dynamics, trophic interactions and the impacts of climate change. Long-term time series are an important tool for monitoring changes in ecological communities, but time series from a single location may not be representative of regional dynamics. In the German Bight, the Helgoland Roads time series is such a long-term series. Here, we consider the spatial dynamics of the eukaryotic microbes as an indicator of the representativeness of the Helgoland Roads site for the coastal German Bight, which is located in the North Sea. The eukaryotic microbial community in the German Bight was analysed at Helgoland Roads and two coastal stations (Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven) between March and October 2016 using metabarcoding. In addition, an oceanographical model was used to check for potential hydrological connectivity between the stations during the sampling period. Our results showed that the communities were different at the three stations. Helgoland was dominated by dinoflagellates, whereas the coastal stations had more diverse communities. Furthermore, differences were observed in the dinoflagellate and diatom communities between the three stations. Lagrangian particle tracking applied to the model results, showed limited connectivity between Helgoland and the coastal stations in 2016. The differences between Helgoland and the coastal stations were correlated with the different hydrological regimes and associated nutrient contents. Our observations suggest the presence of different eukaryotic microbial communities separated by complex hydrological conditions in the coastal German Bight.},

abstract = {Sequencing of ribosomal DNA clone libraries amplified from environmental DNA has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased. Therefore, even the most intensive rDNA library analyses have recovered only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity. High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here, we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two SSU rDNA diversity markers-the variable V4 and V9 regions-from 10 L of anoxic Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454 sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most tags detected represent genotypes not currently in GenBank, although many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological significance of this high amplicon diversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent advances in sequencing strategies make possible unprecedented depth and scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Two major paradigm-shifting discoveries include the detection of bacterial diversity that is one to two orders of magnitude greater than previous estimates, and the discovery of an exciting 'rare biosphere' of molecular signatures ('species') of poorly understood ecological significance. We applied a high-throughput parallel tag sequencing (454 sequencing) protocol adopted for eukaryotes to investigate protistan community complexity in two contrasting anoxic marine ecosystems (Framvaren Fjord, Norway; Cariaco deep-sea basin, Venezuela). Both sampling sites have previously been scrutinized for protistan diversity by traditional clone library construction and Sanger sequencing. By comparing these clone library data with 454 amplicon library data, we assess the efficiency of high-throughput tag sequencing strategies. We here present a novel, highly conservative bioinformatic analysis pipeline for the processing of large tag sequence data sets.RESULTS:The analyses of ca. 250,000 sequence reads revealed that the number of detected Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) far exceeded previous richness estimates from the same sites based on clone libraries and Sanger sequencing. More than 90{\%} of this diversity was represented by OTUs with less than 10 sequence tags. We detected a substantial number of taxonomic groups like Apusozoa, Chrysomerophytes, Centroheliozoa, Eustigmatophytes, hyphochytriomycetes, Ichthyosporea, Oikomonads, Phaeothamniophytes, and rhodophytes which remained undetected by previous clone library-based diversity surveys of the sampling sites. The most important innovations in our newly developed bioinformatics pipeline employ (i) BLASTN with query parameters adjusted for highly variable domains and a complete database of public ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences for taxonomic assignments of tags; (ii) a clustering of tags at k differences (Levenshtein distance) with a newly developed algorithm enabling very fast OTU clustering for large tag sequence data sets; and (iii) a novel parsing procedure to combine the data from individual analyses.CONCLUSION:Our data highlight the magnitude of the under-sampled 'protistan gap' in the eukaryotic tree of life. This study illustrates that our current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, and of the global species richness and genome diversity of protists, is severely limited. Even though 454 pyrosequencing is not a panacea, it allows for more comprehensive insights into the diversity of protistan communities, and combined with appropriate statistical tools, enables improved ecological interpretations of the data and projections of global diversity.},

abstract = {Crop plants carry an enormous diversity of microbiota that provide massive benefits to hosts. Protists, as the main microbial consumers and a pivotal driver of biogeochemical cycling processes, remain largely understudied in the plant microbiome. Here, we characterized the diversity and composition of protists in sorghum leaf phyllosphere, and rhizosphere and bulk soils, collected from an 8-year field experiment with multiple fertilization regimes. Phyllosphere was an important habitat for protists, dominated by Rhizaria, Alveolata and Amoebozoa. Rhizosphere and bulk soils had a significantly higher diversity of protists than the phyllosphere, and the protistan community structure significantly differed among the three plant–soil compartments. Fertilization significantly altered specific functional groups of protistan consumers and parasites. Variation partitioning models revealed that soil properties, bacteria and fungi predicted a significant proportion of the variation in the protistan communities. Changes in protists may in turn significantly alter the compositions of bacterial and fungal communities from the top-down control in food webs. Altogether, we provide novel evidence that fertilization significantly affects the functional groups of protistan consumers and parasites in crop-associated microbiomes, which have implications for the potential changes in their ecological functions under intensive agricultural managements.},

Protist diversity was higher in February (pre-bloom) compared to April (spring bloom), and was lower in the neuston than in the plankton. Major protist groups, including Stramenopiles and Alveolata, dominated both neuston and plankton assemblages. Chrysophytes and diatoms were enriched in the neuston in April, with diatoms showing distinct changes in community composition between the sampling periods. Pezizomycetes dominated planktonic fungi assemblages, whereas fungal diversity in the neuston was more varied. This is the first study to utilize a molecular-based approach to characterize neustonic protist and fungal assemblages, and provides the most comprehensive diversity assessment to date of this ecosystem.

Metabarcoding revealed multiple errors and biases: Taq polymerase substitution errors and mis-incorporating indels in sequencing homopolymers constitute major errors; sequence length biases occur during PCR, library preparation, loading to the sequencing instrument and quality filtering; primer–template mismatches bias the taxonomic profile when using regular and highly degenerate primers. The RSII and Sequel platforms enable the sequencing of amplicons up to 3000 bp, but the sequence quality remains slightly inferior to Illumina sequencing especially in longer amplicons. The full ITS barcode and flanking rRNA small subunit gene greatly improve taxonomic identification at the species and phylum levels, respectively. We conclude that PacBio sequencing provides a viable alternative for metabarcoding of organisms that are of relatively low diversity, require {\textgreater} 500-bp barcode for reliable identification or when phylogenetic approaches are intended.},

abstract = {Heterotrophic marine flagellates (HF) are ubiquitous in the world's oceans and represented in nearly all branches of the domain Eukaryota. However, the factors determining distributions of major taxonomic groups are poorly known. The Arctic Ocean is a good model environment for examining the distribution of functionally similar but phylogenetically diverse HF because the physical oceanography and annual ice cycles result in distinct environments that could select for microbial communities or favor specific taxa. We reanalyzed new and previously published high-throughput sequencing data from multiple studies in the Arctic Ocean to identify broad patterns in the distribution of individual taxa. HF accounted for fewer than 2{\%} to over one-half of the reads from the water column and for up to 60{\%} of reads from ice, which was dominated by Cryothecomonas . In the water column, many HF phylotypes belonging to Telonemia and Picozoa, uncultured marine stramenopiles (MAST), and choanoflagellates were geographically widely distributed. However, for two groups in particular, Telonemia and Cryothecomonas , some species level taxa showed more restricted distributions. For example, several phylotypes of Telonemia favored open waters with lower nutrients such as the Canada Basin and offshore of the Mackenzie Shelf. In summary, we found that while some Arctic HF were successful over a range of conditions, others could be specialists that occur under particular conditions. We conclude that tracking species level diversity in HF not only is feasible but also provides a potential tool for understanding the responses of marine microbial ecosystems to rapidly changing ice regimes.},

Within a few days after fertilization, a phytoplankton bloom developed dominated by nano- and picoplankton groups. Unlike previously reported for other iron fertilization experiments, a diatom bloom was prevented by iron and silicate co-limitation.

However, the same clades were also dominant before the bloom and outside the fertilized patch. Furthermore, only little changes in diversity could be observed over the course of the experiment. These results were corroborated by CARD-FISH analysis which confirmed the presence of a stable nano- and picoplankton community dominated by {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Phaeocystis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Micromonas{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} during the entire course of the experiment. Interestingly, although Syndiniales dominated the tag sequences, they could hardly be detected by CARD-FISH, possibly due to the intracellular parasitic life style of this clade.

We investigated epibiotic microeukaryotes on seagrass (Zostera marina) leaves, substrates, and planktonic microeukaryotes in ten meadows in the Northeast Pacific. Seagrass epibiotic communities are distinct from planktonic and substrate communities. We found sixteen core microeukaryotes, including dinoflagellates, diatoms, and saprotrophic stramenopiles. Some likely use seagrass leaves as a substrate, others for grazing, or they may be saprotrophic organisms involved in seagrass decomposition or parasites; their relatives have been previously reported from marine sediments and in association with other hosts such as seaweeds. Core microeukaryotes were spatially structured, and none were ubiquitous across meadows. Seagrass epibiota were more spatially structured than planktonic communities, mostly due to spatial distance and changes in abiotic conditions across space. Seawater communities were relatively more similar in composition across sites and more influenced by the environmental component, but more variable over time. Core and transient taxa were both mostly structured by spatial distance and the abiotic environment, with little effect of host attributes, further indicating that those core taxa would not show a strong specific association with Z. marina.},

abstract = {Pseudo-nitzschia H. Peragallo (1900) is a globally distributed genus of pennate diatoms that are important components of phytoplankton communities worldwide. Some members of the genus produce the neurotoxin domoic acid, so regular monitoring is in place. However, the identification of toxic members in routine samplings remains problematic. In this study, the diversity and seasonal occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia species were investigated in the Gulf of Trieste, a shallow gulf in the northern Adriatic Sea. We used time series data from 2005 to 2018 to describe the seasonal and inter-annual occurrence of the genus in the area and its contribution to the phytoplankton community. On average, the genus accounted for about 15 {\%} of total diatom abundance and peaked in spring and autumn, with occasional outbreaks during summer and large inter-annual fluctuations. Increased water temperature and decreased salinity positively affected the presence of some members of the genus, while strong effects could be masked by an unsuitable definition of the species complexes used for monitoring purposes. Therefore, combining morphological (TEM) and molecular analyses by sequencing the ITS, 28S and rbcL markers, eight species were identified from 83 isolated monoclonal strains: P. calliantha, P. fraudulenta, P. delicatissima, P. galaxiae, P. mannii, P. multistriata, P. pungens and P. subfraudulenta. A genetic comparison between the isolated strains and other strains in the Mediterranean was carried out and rbcL was inspected as a potential barcode marker in respect to our results. This is the first study in the Gulf of Trieste on Pseudo-nitzschia time series from a long-term ecological research (LTER) site coupled with molecular data. We show that meaningful ecological conclusions can be drawn by applying integrative methodology, as opposed to the approach that only considers species complexes. The results of this work will provide guidance for further monitoring efforts as well as research activities, including population genetics and genomics, associated with seasonal distribution and toxicity profiles.},

abstract = {With the growing anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems, the need for efficient monitoring of biodiversity grows stronger. DNA metabarcoding of bulk samples is increasingly being implemented in ecosystem assessments and is more cost-efficient and less time-consuming than monitoring based on morphology. However, before raw sequences are obtained from bulk samples, a profound number of methodological choices must be made. Here, we critically review the recent methods used for metabarcoding of marine bulk samples (including benthic, plankton and diet samples) and indicate how potential biases can be introduced throughout sampling, preprocessing, DNA extraction, marker and primer selection, PCR amplification and sequencing. From a total of 64 studies evaluated, our recommendations for best practices include to (a) consider DESS as a fixative instead of ethanol, (b) use the DNeasy PowerSoil kit for any samples containing traces of sediment, (c) not limit the marker selection to COI only, but preferably include multiple markers for higher taxonomic resolution, (d) avoid touchdown PCR profiles, (e) use a fixed annealing temperature for each primer pair when comparing across studies or institutes, (f) use a minimum of three PCR replicates, and (g) include both negative and positive controls. Although the implementation of DNA metabarcoding still faces several technical complexities, we foresee wide-ranging advances in the near future, including improved bioinformatics for taxonomic assignment, sequencing of longer fragments and the use of whole-genome information. Despite the bulk of biases involved in metabarcoding of bulk samples, if appropriate controls are included along the data generation process, it is clear that DNA metabarcoding provides a valuable tool in ecosystem assessments.},

abstract = {Diatoms are excellent ecological indicators of water quality because they are broadly distributed, they show high species diversity and they respond rapidly to human pressures. In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) gives the legal basis for the use of this indicator for water quality assessment and its management. Several quality indices, like the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI), were developed to assess the ecological quality status of rivers based on diatom communities. It is based on morphological identifications and count of diatom species present in natural biofilms using a microscope. This methodology requires high taxonomic skills and several hours of analysis per sample as 400 individuals must be identified to species level. Since several years, a molecular approach based on DNA metabarcoding combined to High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is developed to characterize species assemblages in environmental samples which is potentially faster and cheaper. The ability of this approach to provide reliable diatom inventories has been demonstrated and its application to water quality assessment is currently being improved. Despite optimization of the DNA metabarcoding process with diatoms, few studies had yet extended it at the scale of a freshwater monitoring network and evaluated the reliability of its quality assessment compared to the classical morphological approach. In the present study we applied DNA metabarcoding to the river monitoring network of the tropical Island Mayotte. This island is a French d{\'{e}}partement since 2011 and the WFD has to be applied. This offered the opportunity to scale up the comparison of molecular and morphological approaches and their ability to produce comparable community inventories and water quality assessments. Benthic diatoms were sampled following WFD standards in 45 river sites in 2014 and 2015 (80 samples). All samples were submitted in parallel to the molecular and the morphological approaches. DNA metabarcoding was carried out using Genelute DNA extraction method, rbcL DNA barcode and PGM sequencing, while microscopic counts were carried out for the classical methodology. Diatom community structures in terms of molecular (OTUs) and of morphological (species) were significantly correlated. However, only 13{\%} of the species was shared by both approaches, with qualitative and quantitative variation due to i) the incompleteness of the reference library (82{\%} of morphological species are not represented in the database), ii) limits in taxonomic knowledge and iii) biases in the estimation of relative abundances linked to diatom cell biovolume. However, ecological quality status assessed with the molecular and morphological SPI values were congruent, and little affected by sequencing depth. DNA metabarcoding of diatom communities allowed a reliable estimation of the quality status for most of the rivers at the scale of the full biomonitoring network of Mayotte Island.},

Hence, monitoring microbial communities in recreational waters is important for potential public health threats to humans. Such monitoring is rare in Colombia, even in its capital, Bogot{\'{a}}, the most populous city in the country. This city encompasses metropolitan and linear parks with recreational water bodies that are used frequently by the public, and the presence of pathogens can compromise the health of the citizens. Therefore, we examined the bacterial, and eukaryotic communities in urban recreational lakes (URL) in four metropolitan parks in Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia. Samples from four metropolitan parks (Los Novios, Simon Bolivar, El Tunal, and Timiza) and one stream contaminated with sewage from a linear park (El Virrey) were collected. We used amplicon next-generation sequencing of the 16S-rRNA gene and 18S-rRNA gene to characterize microbial communities followed by bioinformatics analyses. In addition, general water quality parameters—pH, hardness, acidity, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, and nitrites—were recorded using a commercial kit. Genera of pathogens, including Legionella, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Candida, and Naegleria, were found in lake waters. The stream El Virrey was, however, the only surface water that showed an abundance of fecal bacteria, often associated with low oxygen concentrations. All water bodies showed a predominance of fungal phyla, except for the lake at Timiza. This lake showed the highest pH, and its ecological dynamics are likely different from other water bodies. Likewise, some URLs displayed a greater abundance of cyanobacteria, including toxin-producing species. Algal genera associated with eutrophication were predominant among primary producing microorganisms. This study shows for the first time the description of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities of some URLs and a stream in Bogot{\'{a}}. The URLs and the stream harbored various pathogens that might pose a risk to the citizen's health.},

Here we tested the possibility to overcome these limitations by using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to identify and quantify diatoms found in environmental DNA and RNA samples. We analysed 27 river sites in the Geneva area (Switzerland), in order to compare the values of the Swiss Diatom Index (DI-CH) computed either by microscopic quantification of diatom species or directly from NGS data. Despite gaps in the reference database and variations in relative abundance of analysed species, the diatom index shows a significant correlation between morphological and molecular data indicating similar biological quality status for the majority of sites.

Relationships between marine microbial community composition and NCP currently remain unclear despite their importance for assessing how different taxa impact carbon export. We conducted 16 and 18S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequencing on samples collected across the Western North Atlantic in parallel with high-resolution O2/Ar-derived NCP measurements. Using an internal standard technique to estimate in-situ prokaryotic and eukaryotic rDNA abundances per liter, we employed statistical approaches to relate patterns of microbial diversity to NCP. Taxonomic abundances calculated using internal standards provided valuable context to traditional relative abundance metrics. A bloom in the Mid-Atlantic Bight featured high eukaryote abundances with low eukaryotic diversity and was associated with the harmful algal bloom-forming Aureococcus anophagefferens, phagotrophic algae, heterotrophic flagellates, and particle-associated bacteria. These results show that coastal Aureococcus blooms host a distinct community associated with regionally significant peaks in NCP. Meanwhile, weak relationships between taxonomy and NCP in less-productive waters suggest that productivity across much of this region is not linked to specific microplankton taxa.},

abstract = {Testate amoebae are widely distributed in natural ecosystems and play an important role in the material cycle and energy flow. However, community assembly of testate amoebae is not well understood, especially with regard to the relative importance of the stochastic and deterministic processes over time. In this study, we used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to explore the community assembly of testate amoebae from surface waters in two reservoirs of subtropical China over a seven-year period. Majority of testate amoebae belonged to the rare taxa because their relative abundances were typically lower than 0.01{\%} of the total eukaryotic plankton community. The testate amoeba community dynamics exhibited a stronger interannual than seasonal variation in both reservoirs. Further, species richness, rather than species turnover, accounted for the majority of community variation. Environmental variables explained less than 20{\%} of the variation in community composition of testate amoebae, and the community assembly appeared to be strongly driven by stochastic processes. Based on the Sloan neutral community model, it was found that neutral processes explained more than 65{\%} of community variation. More importantly, the Stegen null model analysis showed that the stochastic processes (e.g., ecological drift) explained a significantly higher percentage of community assembly than deterministic processes over seven years, although deterministic processes were more influential in certain years. Our results provide new perspectives for understanding the ecological patterns, processes and mechanisms of testate amoeba communities in freshwater ecosystems at temporal scale, and have important implications for monitoring plankton diversity and protecting drinking-water resources.},

abstract = {Knowledge about the protist diversity of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean is scarce. We tested the hypothesis that distinct protist community assemblages characterize large-scale water masses. Therefore, we determined the composition and biogeography of late summer protist assemblages along a transect from the coast of New Zealand to the eastern Ross Sea. We used state of the art molecular approaches, such as automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and 454-pyrosequencing, combined with high-performance liquid chromatography pigment analysis to study the protist assemblage. We found distinct biogeographic patterns defined by the environmental conditions in the particular region. Different water masses harbored different microbial communities. In contrast to the Arctic Ocean, picoeukaryotes had minor importance throughout the investigated transect and showed very low contribution south of the Polar Front. Dinoflagellates, Syndiniales, and small stramenopiles were dominating the sequence assemblage in the Subantarctic Zone, whereas the relative abundance of diatoms increased southwards, in the Polar Frontal Zone and Antarctic Zone. South of the Polar Front, most sequences belonged to haptophytes. This study delivers a comprehensive and taxon detailed overview of the protist composition in the investigated area during the austral summer 2010.},

abstract = {In the ongoing discussion of the distribution of protists, whether they are globally distributed or endemic to one or both of the polar regions is the subject of heated debate. In this study, we compared next-generation sequencing data from the Arctic and the Southern oceans to reveal the extent of similarities and dissimilarities between the protist communities in the polar regions. We found a total overlap of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between the two regions of 11.2{\%}. On closer inspection of different taxonomic groups, the overlap ranged between 5.5{\%} (haptophytes) and 14.5{\%} (alveolates). Within the different groups, the proportion of OTUs occurring in both regions greatly differed between the polar regions. On the one hand, the overlap between these two regions is remarkable, given the geographical distance between them. On the other hand, one could expect a greater overlap of OTUs between these regions on account of the similar environmental conditions. The overlap suggests a connection between the polar regions for at least certain species or that the evolutionary divergence has been slow, relative to the timescales of isolation. The different proportions of common OTUs among the groups or regions may be a result of different life cycle strategies or environmental adaptations.},

abstract = {Microeukaryotes are the key ecosystem drivers mediating marine productivity, the food web and biogeochemical cycles. The northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO), as one of the world's largest oligotrophic regions, remains largely unexplored regarding diversity and biogeography of microeukaryotes. Here, we investigated the community composition and geographical distribution of microeukaryotes collected from the euphotic zone of three different regions in the NWPO using high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and quantified the contributions of environmental factors on the distributions of microeukaryotes. The relative abundance of different group taxa, except for Ciliophora, presented distinct patterns in each region, and Metazoa and Dinoflagellata dominated the community, contributing approximately half of reads abundance. Spatial and environmental factors explained 66.01{\%} of community variation in the NWPO. Temperature was the most important environmental factor significantly correlated with community structure. Bacterial biomass was also significantly correlated with microeukaryotic distribution, especially for Dinoflagellata and Diatomea. Network analysis showed strong correlations between microeukaryotic groups and free-living bacteria and different bacterial taxa were correlated with specific microeukaryotic groups, indicating that their interactions enabled microeukaryotic groups to adapt to diverse environments. This study provides a first glance at the diversity and geographical distribution of microeukaryotes in the NWPO and sheds light on the biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the microeukaryotic community in the ocean.},

Here, we performed HiSeq paired‐end sequencing of the V4 region of 18S rRNA gene, using both DNA and RNA extracts, to identify protist communities in the surface and bottom water layers along a transect of the Pearl River‐South China Sea Continuum (PSC) during the wet (summer) and dry (winter) seasons. We found that during the summer but not during the winter, protist communities, identified from their DNA or RNA signatures, could be better explained by mass effects and species sorting, respectively. Moreover, protist diversity in the DNA and RNA surveys, exhibited similar trends along the transect; i.e., a linear upstream‐to‐downstream decrease during the summer, and a weakly U‐shaped curve during the winter. In contrast, the taxonomic compositions in the DNA‐ and RNA‐derived communities were remarkably different during either the summer or the winter. In summary, the results of our DNA and RNA surveys revealed the temporal assembly of protist communities in the PSC, which suggests that protist diversity and composition are highly responsive to the hydrographic conditions of the river‐sea continuum.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Background: Plant health is intimately influenced by the rhizosphere microbiome, a complex assembly of organisms that changes markedly across plant growth. However, most rhizosphere microbiome research has focused on fractions of this microbiome, particularly bacteria and fungi. It remains unknown how other microbial components, especially key microbiome predators-protists-are linked to plant health. Here, we investigated the holistic rhizosphere microbiome including bacteria, microbial eukaryotes (fungi and protists), as well as functional microbial metabolism genes. We investigated these communities and functional genes throughout the growth of tomato plants that either developed disease symptoms or remained healthy under field conditions. Results: We found that pathogen dynamics across plant growth is best predicted by protists. More specifically, communities of microbial-feeding phagotrophic protists differed between later healthy and diseased plants at plant establishment. The relative abundance of these phagotrophs negatively correlated with pathogen abundance across plant growth, suggesting that predator-prey interactions influence pathogen performance. Furthermore, phagotrophic protists likely shifted bacterial functioning by enhancing pathogen-suppressing secondary metabolite genes involved in mitigating pathogen success.},

abstract = {Cryptophytes are a ubiquitous algal group and are important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Identification of lineages within the group is difficult because of their simple morphology and they are often enumerated at the class level in ecological research. Despite the increasing number of molecular probes used for identification of microorganisms, rRNA genes (i.e. nuclear 18S, ITS, and 28S, and nucleomorph 18S) are the markers most commonly used to identify cryptophytes. To provide a broader choice of markers, we compared and characterised the utility of 13 plastid genes in 23 culture strains, which cover the spectrum cryptophycean lineages (Clades 1–5). The genes include 11 protein-coding (atpA, atpB, chlI, clpC, dnaK, psaA, psbA, rbcL, rpoC1, secA, and tufA) and two ribosomal RNA (plastid 16S and 23S) genes. Most of the genes were successfully amplified and sequenced using newly designed primers, and the sequences aligned with minimal indels. The protein-coding genes showed higher levels of divergence (P-distance, and synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates) and higher identification index than those of rRNAs. Considering divergence and phylogenetic usefulness, we selected atpB, psaA, and rbcL as the best candidates for cryptophycean clade identification and further field research.},

abstract = {The calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus is one of the most abundant and ecologically important species of the zooplankton assemblage of the North Atlantic Ocean and occupies a pivotal position in the pelagic food web. This study used metabarcoding analysis (high throughput DNA sequencing of target gene regions) to examine the diversity of the copepod gut content, including both eukaryotic and prokaryotic components of the diet and microbiome. Zooplankton samples were collected during the 2013 EuroBASIN cruise of the R/V G.O. Sars, which crossed the North Atlantic to survey in the Norwegian, Icelandic, Irminger, and Labrador Seas. Zooplankton samples were examined microscopically for C. finmarchicus; species identification was confirmed by genetic markers based on insertion-deletion sequence variation. DNA was extracted from the dissected gut contents of adult female copepods and sequenced for eukaryotic 18S V4 and prokaryotic 16S V3–V4 rRNA hypervariable regions. Prokaryotes identified in the gut contents of all copepods analyzed included Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. The eukaryotic gut content assemblage was diverse, dominated by Ocrophyta (diatoms), Dinophyta (dinoflagellates), Ciliophora (ciliates), as well as Cnidaria and Ctenophora. The diverse assemblage revealed by metabarcoding analysis of copepod gut contents likely represents prey, microbiome, parasites, symbionts, and pathogens. Significant differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic diversity of the gut contents of copepods collected from four regional seas of the North Atlantic Ocean reflect and contribute to basin-scale differences in the pelagic food web of these ecosystems. This study provides evidence that diversity and variation of the copepod gut contents may both reflect and impact the functioning of pelagic food webs and regional variation in ocean ecosystems.},

abstract = {We developed a cost-effective metabarcoding strategy to analyze phytoplankton community structure using the Illumina MiSeq system. The amplicons (404--411 bp) obtained by end-pairing of two reads were sufficiently long to distinguish algal species and provided barcode data equivalent to those generated with the Roche 454 system, but at less than 1/20th of the cost. The original universal primer sequences targeting the 23S rDNA region and the PCR strategy were both modified, and this resulted in higher numbers of eukaryotic algal sequences by excluding non-photosynthetic proteobacterial sequences supporting effectiveness of this strategy. The novel strategy was used to analyze the phytoplankton community structure of six water samples from the East/Japan Sea: surface and 50 m depths at coastal and open-sea sites, with collections in May and July 2014. In total, 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, which covered most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic algal phyla, including Dinophyta, Rhodophyta, Ochrophyta, Chlorophyta, Streptophyta, Cryptophyta, Haptophyta, and Cyanophyta. This highlights the importance of plastid 23S primers, which perform better than the currently used 16S primers for phytoplankton community surveys. The findings also revealed that more efforts should be made to update 23S rDNA sequences as well as those of 16S in the databases. Analysis of algal proportions in the six samples showed that community structure differed depending on location, depth and season. Across the six samples evaluated, the numbers of OTUs in each phylum were similar but their relative proportions varied. This novel strategy would allow laboratories to analyze large numbers of samples at reasonable expense, whereas this has not been possible to date due to cost and time. In addition, we expect that this strategy will generate a large amount of novel data that could potentially change established methods and tools that are currently used in the realms of oceanography and marine ecology.},

abstract = {Microeukaryotic plankton are important components of aquatic environments and play key roles in marine microbial food webs; however, little is known about their genetic diversity in subtropical offshore areas. Here we examined the community composition and genetic diversity of the microeukaryotic plankton in Xiamen offshore water by PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis), clone-based sequencing and Illumina based sequencing. The Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed a much (approximately two orders of magnitude) higher species richness of the microeukaryotic community than DGGE, but there were no significant difference in species richness and diversity among the northern, eastern, southern or western stations based on both methods. In this study, Copepoda, Ciliophora, Chlorophyta, Dinophyceae, Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta (diatoms) were the dominant groups even though diatoms were not detected by DGGE. Our Illumina based results indicated that two northern communities (sites N2 and N3) were significantly different from others in having more protozoa and fewer diatoms. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that both temperature and salinity were the significant environmental factors influencing dominant species communities, whereas the full microeukaryotic community appeared to be affected by a complex of environmental factors. Our results suggested that extensive sampling combined with more deep sequencing are needed to obtain the complete diversity of the microeukaryotic community, and different diversity patterns for both abundant and rare taxa may be important in evaluating the marine ecosystem health.},

abstract = {In this study, the evolution of ballast water (BW) assemblages across different trophic
23 levels was characterized over a 21-day cross-latitudinal vessel transit using a
24 combination of molecular methods. Triplicate ballast water (BW) samples were collected
25 every second day and size fractionated ({\textless}2.7 �m, 10 �m, {\textgreater}50 �m). Measurements of
26 adenosine triphosphate (ATP), metabarcoding of environmental nucleic acids (DNA and
RNA) analyses, complemented by microscopy and flow-cytometry were performed on
28 each sample. Measured ATP concentrations exhibited high variance between replicates,
29 and a strong negative trend in the large (��50 �m) fraction over the voyage. In concert with
30 microscopy, the metabarcoding data indicated a die-off of larger metazoans during the
31 first week of study, and gradual reductions in dinoflagellates and ochrophytes. The ATP
32 and metabarcoding data signaled persistent or increased cellular activity of heterotrophic
33 bacteria and protists in the BW, which was supported by flow-cytometry. The
34 metabarcoding showed the presence of active bacteria in all size fractions suggesting
35 that the sequential filtration approach does not ensure taxonomical differentiation, which
36 has implications for BW quality assessment. Although our data show that ATP and
37 metabarcoding have potential for indicative ballast water screening for BW compliance
38 monitoring, further research and technological development is needed to improve
39 representativeness of sampling and deliver the unequivocal response criteria required by
40 the international Ballast Water Management Convention

abstract = {Knowledge of zooplankton in situ diet is critical for accurate assessment of marine ecosystem function and structure, but due to methodological constraints, there is still a limited understanding of ecological networks in marine ecosystems. Here, we used DNA-metabarcoding to study trophic interactions, with the aim to unveil the natural diet of zooplankton species under temporal variation of food resources. Several target consumers, including copepods and cladocerans, were investigated by sequencing 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to identify prokaryote and eukaryote potential prey present in their guts. During the spring phytoplankton bloom, we found a dominance of diatom and dinoflagellate trophic links to copepods. During the summer period, zooplankton including cladocerans showed a more diverse diet dominated by cyanobacteria and heterotrophic prey. Our study suggests that copepods present trophic plasticity, changing their natural diet over seasons, and adapting their feeding strategies to the available prey spectrum, with some species being more selective. We did not find a large overlap of prey consumed by copepods and cladocerans, based on prey diversity found in their guts, suggesting that they occupy different roles in the trophic web. This study represents the first molecular approach to investigate several zooplankton–prey associations under seasonal variation, and highlights how, unlike other techniques, the diversity coverage is high when using DNA, allowing the possibility to detect a wide range of trophic interactions in plankton communities.},

abstract = {Benthic microeukaryotes are key ecosystem drivers in marine sandy beaches, an important and dynamic environment; however, little is known about their diversity and biogeography on a large spatial scale. Here we investigated the community composition and geographical distributions of benthic microeukaryotes using high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rDNA, and quantified the contributions of environmental factors and spatial separation on the distribution patterns of both rare and abundant taxa. We collected 36 intertidal samples at 12 sandy beaches from four regions that spanned distances from 0.001 to 12,000 km. We found 12890 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97{\%} sequence identity level) including members of all eukaryotic super-groups and several phyla of uncertain position. Arthropoda and Diatomeae dominated the sequence reads in abundance, but Ciliophora and Discoba were the most diverse groups across all samples. About one-third of the OTUs could not be definitively classified at a similarity level of 80{\%}, supporting the view that a large number of rare and minute marine species may have escaped previous characterization. We found generally similar geographical patterns for abundant and rare microeukaryotic sub-communities and both showed a significant distance-decay similarity trend. Variation partitioning showed that both rare and abundant sub-communities exhibited a slightly stronger response to environmental factors than spatial (distance) factors. However, the abundant sub-community was strongly correlated with variations in spatial, environmental and sediment grain size factors (66{\%} of variance explained), but the rare assemblage was not (16{\%}). This suggests that different or more complex mechanisms generate and maintain diversity in the rare biosphere in this habitat.},

abstract = {Comparing phytoplankton non-bloom and bloom communities using rRNA and its coding gene can help understand the shift of dominant species and its driving processes (e.g., intrinsic growth or grazing). Here we conducted high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA and its coding gene for studying non-bloom and bloom plankton communities in East China Sea. The non-bloom community was dominated by diatoms whereas during the bloom it was dominated by the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum shikokuense (formerly P. donghaiense). P. shikokuense rRNA abundance and rRNA:rRNA gene ratio both increased markedly in the bloom, indicating that the bloom arose from active growth. In contrast, some non-bloom species showed low DNA abundances during the bloom albeit high rRNA:rRNA gene ratios, suggesting that cell loss processes such as grazing might have prevented these species from blooming or that these species might be at an early stage of bloom development. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that dinoflagellate abundance was positively correlated with temperature and negatively related to dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations, suggesting warm and DIP-poor environment as a niche space for P. shikokuense. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of combined analysis of rRNA and its gene in characterizing phytoplankton bloom development to shed light on the complex phytoplankton dynamics and regulating mechanisms in the course of bloom development.},

abstract = {Microeukaryotes are mainly composed of highly diverse and abundant protists, whose diversity and distribution in deep oceans have not been well studied. We investigated the vertical profiles of microeukaryotes throughout the water column down to abyssal sediments and their horizontal distribution over a distance of 1,300 km in the Western Pacific Ocean, using high throughput DNA sequencing. A distinct vertical distribution was detected for microeukaryote communities, which could be clustered into euphotic, aphotic and sediment groups. Nearly half of the operational taxonomic units detected in the sediment samples were also found in overlying water, indicating a frequent species exchange between seawater habitats and abyssal sediment habitats, which was similar to that observed for prokaryote communities. On the horizontal scaling side, a significant distance-decay relationship was found in the microeukaryote community. Furthermore, the major microeukaryotic groups revealed different distance-decay patterns which appeared to be significant for Dinoflagellata and Radiolaria, but insignificant for Ciliophora. Environmental selection contributed more to the variations in microeukaryote and Dinoflagellata communities than neutral processes, whereas neutral processes explained more variations in Radiolaria community. Generally, community variations explained by both processes were less than 30{\%}, which was lower than that in coastal zones. These results imply that the complex distribution pattern within microeukaryote communities and more drivers, such as currents, water mass and biotic interactions, might contribute in shaping the distribution of microeukaryotes in the open ocean.},

annote = {Dear Amel

Thanks you for your revision. However before the paper can be definitively accepted there are a few things that need to be adressed.

1. You have adressed most of the reviewer concerns, however I agree with rev 3 that Fig. 7 is very confusing and ahrd to read. I would recommend that you follow his/her advice and redraw the figures. Moreoever, please do not use abbreviated labels for environmental parameters and groups but the full names, this will make things much more easy...

2. You mention two databases that you have used in addition of PR2. The first problem is that they are not public and therefore cannot be mentionned. The second problem is that they just seem to be used to confirm PR2. So either you make them public or better you do not mention them.

3. Very important. Your HTS data do not seem to have been deposited to any public web site. Before the paper can be published.
a. You need to deposit the raw to the SRA of GenBank or EBI whatever is most easy to you
b. You need to deposit on a open sharing service such as Figshare three files 1. OTU sequences as fasta, 2. OTU taxonomy and 3. OTU abundance vs sample matrix.
This will allow other researchers to access your data.

4. I have made some corrections, comments in the file itself. But please in addition, streamline the text. There many places where sentences can be made shorter.
==========================================

Dear Amel

As you will see all three reviewers recommend publication after taking into account their comments. I would recommend that you improve the quality of the figures. In particular the asepct reations Fig. 2 and 5 have obviously been changed which result in weird fonts. When you do this you should uncouple the text from the figure itself.

Summary: 
This study investigated spatial and temporal trends among picoeukaryotes in the Gulf of Gabes using DGGE and V4-tag sequencing approaches. Community diversity was found to be related to distance to shore, season, and water mass type. Authors clearly know how to properly use these techniques for examining marine microbial eukaryotic populations. With the sampling region understudied and the corresponding physical measurements (water mass data), this paper is unique and adds to the field of protistan ecology. I suggest this paper for publication. While I provided a lot of comments, I think the comments and suggestion serve to ensure the authors work is more effectively conveyed to a reader. 

Overall comments: 
(1) Carefully edit whole paper for grammar - some language is confusing. I have noted many places where the text should be rewritten. 
(2) Include table to clarify sample information. I would suggest a new way to identify and label stations with depth, season, and sampling type. This would make Figures 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 much clearer to read. For example, assign shapes for each month and fill in shapes with numbers corresponding to sampling depth. Additionally, I strongly suggest authors state "off shore" versus "on shore" stations, e.g. stations 1-5 are coastal and 7-12 are off shore. Maybe a color can be assigned coastal versus offshore. 
(3) In authors' analysis, they use both NMDS and co-inertia approach to cluster samples (based on the tag sequencing). I would suggest that the authors include only one (either NMDS or co-inertia) in the main text and the other type of analysis in the supplementary, as both approaches are still valuable. It was unclear if the same Bray-Curtis dissimilarity data went into the co-inertia analysis as the NMDS. If the same data was put into the co-inertia approach, I suggest the authors only include Figure 6 or 7, but not both. Because the same clustering patterns were observed in both Fig 6 and 7, the figures seem redundant. 
a. One option: in the vegan R package you can perform analysis of similarities (anosim()) to look for significant variables (like the environmental parameters included in Fig 7) related to your data. If you were to include environmental parameters (as done in Fig. 7) into the NMDS plot, Figure 7 could be moved to supplementary. 

Abstract: 
l. 25. remove "the" 
l. 29 change nutrients to nutrient 
l. 34 "were most marked", I'm not sure what this means? what kind of "Change" is this? 
l. 35 "second shift" what kind of shift? Increase? decrease in relative abundance? Shift in species composition? 
l. 39-40. This sentence, starting "A sample clustering..." is unclear. What kind of clustering? Perhaps this sentence can be combine with the sentence after it to be more specific. 

Introduction: 
l. 73 and 78, define "smaller microbes" and "very small cells" - nominally define picoeukaryote. 
ll. 81-83 Confusingly worded sentence. This is an example of sentence structure in which the reader could be lost in what the authors are trying to convey. Perhaps: "Despite the oliotrophic character of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Gulf of Gabes exhibits a higher nutrient content throughout the year." 
l. 95 "..and the water masses features." Change to "..and the water mass features." This was found elsewhere in the text, please revise. 

Methods: 
l. 112, change to "..was located at the surface.." 
ll. 112-114. Confusingly worded. I suggest a rewrite or split into two sentences. 
ll. 115-118. Combine sentences? I'm assuming the POEMM3 was in June/summer, POEMM5 in April, etc. 
l. 119 Later in the text you only refer to time points as months (June, etc) not season (summer). Keep this consistent. 
l. 121 Should be "liter" 
ll. 124-129. I found this description of sampling depths confusing. I had to read it several times. I would suggest rewording some of the sentences and including a table (supplementary) with the depths sampled for each station/month and the bottom depth at each station. 
l. 135 Change "later filters" to 0.47 µm filters. 
l. 191. SILVA version? and how was the representative sequences for each OTU chosen? 
l. 194, are those in-house databases publically available? 
l. 200 are the 12,926 OTUs the total number of unique OTUs across 11 samples? or combined total number of OTUs? 
l. 202. I would suggest changing "rarefacted" to "randomly subsampled" 
l. 213-217. What data was put into the co-inertia analysis? It was clear that the Bray-Curtis matrix was used for the NMDS plots, but it is not clear what data was used for the co-inertia analysis. See below for other comments regarding your use of both NMDS and co-inertia analyses. 

Results: 
Overall 
(1) Use in-text citations of your tables and figures more often. It was difficult to follow along in some places of the results section because I had to figure out which figure/table was being discussed. 

l. 236 "It was located at depths..." What was located? Be precise in writing. 
l. 241-243. For Table 1, what depths does this cover? 
ll. 245-246. "Temperature always increased..." This sentence is confusing, and needs citation for both Table 1 and Figure 2? 
ll. 245-254 - include citations for Figure 2 panels. 
l. 255. First sentence of this paragraph is confusingly worded. 
ll. 255-262. Cite Table 1? 
l. 264. What subset of samples? Again, a table may help to clarify to readers what samples were taken, at which depths, and what type of analyses (DGGE vs. tag sequences) was done for each sample. 
ll. 265-266. Remove "on the one hand" and "on the other hand" 
l. 266. Rewrite to "Separate DGGE gels were performed for June 2008 (Figure 3A), April 2009 (Figure 3B), and November 2009 samples (Figure 3C)." 
ll. 264-269 Some of this can/should be addressed in methods instead. i.e. What analysis was performed on what samples and how are all methods-related content. 
ll. 269-270. "DGGE patterns.." High diversity with respect to what? or in comparison to what? Is this among all depths? across months? Cite Figure 3B. 
ll. 272-273. What kind of dominant shift? shift in community composition? Also I would suggest stating somewhere that higher numbered stations are open-sea and lower numbered stations are coastal. This would make it much clearer when the reader is trying to distinguish between the "coastal cluster" that authors discuss on l. 274. Also please cite the proper figure. 
l. 279. Remove sentence "The NMDS plots..." 
ll. 280-287 This paragraph is either misplaced or requires more content regarding community composition. In text citations here only refer to Fig 2 (sal and temp info), but the first sentence appears to relate these physical parameters to the previous paragraphs presentation of picoeukaryotic diversity. Include citations of Fig 3 or combine paragraphs. 
l. 288 Change "run" to "ran" 
ll. 288-298 Please cite Figure 3E and 3D where needed. 

l. 303 change "...this community" to "the picoeukaryotic community" 
l. 312 change to .."dataset, contributing 50.29{\%} of total sequences." 
l. 313 change "during the three periods." to "all three months." 
l. 315-318 remove "Thus,", change "retrieved" to "detected", and remove "depth" on lines 316 and 317. 
l. 319 Change to "Stramenopiles were.." 
l. 320 What are you comparing diversity to? Did the Stramenopiles have the most number of unique OTUs? compared to other taxonomic groups? Please be more precise in how "more diverse" and "most diverse" is defined/used. 
l. 323-324 What percent were MAST-25? Does "offshore surface waters" refer to this study or another? Interesting finding. 
ll. 326-327. change to "..detected, MOCH-2 was the most abundant (1067 reads) and diverse (58 OTUs) relative to all other MOCH groups. 
l. 328 remove "clearly" 
ll. 331 "preferentially detected" - what does this mean? Detected at higher abundances? and in what month? June? 
l. 334, what is meant by "well represented groups"? Is this based on abundance? Same with "important diversity"? How is "important" defined with respect to diversity? 
ll. 339-345 Discusses rare taxa, while ll. 346-357 go back to discussing dominant groups, switch the order of these paragraphs. 
l. 341, Use of "10-262m-Ap" confusing as a sample label. Keep consistent by saying "at depth 262m in April at off shore station 10" instead. Again, a table would be helpful to readers. 
ll. 342-344 confusingly worded, please rewrite. With some samples being "more similar" to other, is this only based on finding similar taxonomic group? or did you perform a separate NMDS plot on the rare taxa? 
l. 349 "increasing relative abundance" with respect to what dimension? spatially? temporally? Do you mean from April to November? and from November to June? 
ll. 350-352. Confusingly worded sentence, starting with "Furthermore, abundance..." 
ll. 353 and 354, What is meant by "prevailing"? Dominant, based on sequence reads? 
ll. 360-361, change to .."diversity indices were higher in offshore stations relative to coastal stations, with...". When authors mention an "increase" they need to explain what was increasing in relative to what else? This will make the results section much easier to read. 
l. 368 change to "composed of" 


Discussion: 
Overall comments: 
(1) I agree that this study takes a good look at the temporal and spatial variability with picoeukaryotes. The clustering of samples with respect to water masses is especially interesting. However, authors needs to be more precise in their descriptions of what their study found. See some examples below of unclear sentences. 

ll. 398-401. These two sentences do not make sense. Needs to be more clearly written and citations for figures need to be included. 
ll. 405-407. Shifts in abundances? or in taxonomic composition? Not sure what "..being the first more pronounced." means? 
ll. 407-409 Combine these two sentences referring to Wu et al. 2014. As is, they are unclear. 
ll. 420-421. Other studies at the SPOT station to cite: Schnetzer et al. 2011, Kim et al. 2014, and Hu et al. 2016. 
ll. 422-425. This is an important sentence summarizing the authors main findings - but it is poorly written. Please cite figures that it refers to. 
ll. 429-441. Good comparison with previous work - however, please include a suggestions for what this might mean for dinoflagellate and picoeukaryotic ecology in this region. This would augment the findings of this study. 
ll. 441-444, What "relationship" is this referring to? Again, please add in why it is important that you've found a correlation between water mass and picoeukaryotic diversity. This is an interesting part of the study. 
l. 457 capitalize Alveolates, keep consistent in text. 
l. 465 change to "..of active or viable MALV cells..." 
l. 491, change "preferentially" 
l. 495 "..favored in deep waters" 
ll. 490-501. This is an interesting finding - please cite figure in text. Authors may also want to cite other recent papers that have noted rhizaria as an important yet understudied group: Biard et al. 2016, Caron 2016, de Vargas et al. 2015, Guidi et al. 2016, Burki {\&} Keeling 2014 
l. ll. 500-501. Reference for nitrogen playing an important role in polycystinea? Or explain further. 
l. 508 Was a diatom bloom confirmed? Or has it been noted in the area before? please cite. 
l. 509 In Hu et al. 2016, intensification of diatoms was also detected at a coastal site with high nutrient concentrations. 


Questions: 
(1) Did you detect pelagophytes? Dupont et al. 2014 (ISMEJ) noted an increase in pelagophyte abundance at sub-surface chlorophyll maximum in oligotrophic regions relative to coastal samples (along the CalCOFI transect). 
(2) ll. 520, Did you see a fare amount of OTUs that were rare in some samples and then abundant in other samples to further support this? 
(3) Comment on the unpublished comparison with Balzano et al. primers - it would seem that as long as sequencing depth is sufficient, the Stoeck et al. V4 primers work well to characterize the community. 

References: 
- I only checked part of the introductory section for proper citations. (1) in-text citations should be in alphabetical order and (2) Hu et al. missing from reference list. (3) l. 715, Should be Zeidner G. {\&} Beja O. 
o Please make sure all references are cited properly. 

Figures 
Figure 1. See overall comment 2. The symbols and numbers are difficult to see in some places on this map, I suggest re-working how each station is labeled. Also, please use another way to delineate which samples were used for HTS, rather than bolding. 

Table 1. Include depth information 

Table 3. Include in the table legend description why those stations and depths were used in this table. 

Figure 2. These figures are very difficult to see. Make sure they are not stretched out and you can see all letters and numbers. Again, the T-S figures (right most panels) would benefit from a new symbol schematic (overall comment {\#}2) 

Figure 3. Note the x-axis in the dendrograms in the figure and in the figure legend. I do not think you need the DGGE gel images, I would suggest moving those to supplementary. This is where delineating between offshore station numbers (higher numbers?) versus coastal stations (smaller numbers?) would be helpful. With the font small and crowded in the middle and right most panels, symbols, colors, and numbers would be useful (see overall comment {\#}2). 

Figure 5. State in the figure legend how "rare" was defined with respect to the whole community.

The article entitled "Picoeukaryotic diversity in the Gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s: variability patterns and relationships to nutrients and water masses", intend to explore the variation of picoeukaryotes communities due to physicochemical factors, in a particular environment with contrasting characteristics, where information about this group is lacking. In the environment analyzed (the gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s), previous data indicate the picoplankton is a huge contributor to the overall chlorophyll biomass. Besides, previous data based on pigments analysis indicates a particular pattern in terms of diversity of picoplanktonic communities, different from other Mediterranean regions dominated by prymnesiophytes. To assess their research goals, the authors used a mixed culture-independent methodology based on fingerprinting techniques and high throughput sequencing of ribosomal genes, using samples obtained during tree courses in the specified region. The authors intend to relate the community composition observed, with environmental parameters like nutrients and temperature, but also with the different water masses present in the region.  The article is well written, with a clear statement of the work objectives. The experimental design and the methods are clearly explained and detailed. Their results showed clearly observed patterns in picoeukaryotes assemblages, driven by the coast offshore gradient, the vertical variations in the offshore stations, the sampling period, and the co-occurrence of different water masses  I find the article very consistent and rigorous. However, I do believe the figures can be much improved, with no a huge load of work for the authors.  1. Figure 2 has the heading a bit blurry, maybe because the authors try to decrease the size to fit it in a composite figure. Please, modify the axis labels. Authors can also include a label (a dot, for example) indicating the depth where they collect the sample, so for the reader will be more easily have a broad picture of the physicochemical parameters in relation to the samples.  2. Figure 3: the authors can flip the DGGE and try to arrange the different lanes in front of the respective branch in the cluster. This will allow the reader to follow more easily the observed patterns. In the same figure, NMDS symbols can be added to the plot, instead of the names of the samples. Default colors used by Primer software are not always the better. Also, please include the label of the X axis on the cluster. Is that similarity? Dissimilarity? Coefficient?  3. Figure 4 and 6 can be fused in one single figure, and they can follow the same scheme than in figure 3. Instead the DGGE, use the heatmap at the side of the cluster. No need of the piecharts if the authors add that info as a hestmap.  4. Figure 7 is critical since is the figure that represents the hypothesis test about the influence of environmental parameters over picoeukaryotes composition. However, in my opinion, the figure is really difficult to follow. I do not believe the circular plots (that shown axis deviations) and the eigenvalues histogram are really needed to give the message. The main graphs (the ordination ones) could also be fused in a single plot, were the X canonical axis (the taxonomy) and the Y canonical axis (the environment) can be easily interpreted in function of total samples distribution.  Other comments to the authors.  5. The authors mention in the methods section that they use PR2 database for taxonomic assignation, but also two in-house databases. Nothing is detailed about the similarities or differences observed between databases. There were consistent? Or they used an integrated database? Please clarify.  6. Since they observe clear clusters, why don't try to add a SIMPROF test to the clusters? In this way, the authors can test if the aggrupation of the different samples is significant (i.e. not due to random processes). This test can be easily run using the same software the authors are using for the clusters (PRIMER).

General comment:
The study by Bellaaj Zouari et al investigates the diversity of marine picoeukaryotes
in the SE Mediterranean in relation to the prevalent oceanographic parameters. For
this purpose the authors analysed the picoplankton diversity with DGGE and a subset
of 11 samples with high throughput sequencing of the V4 region. The sampling took
place over three different seasons (spring 2008, summer 2008 and autumn 2009),
covering coastal and offshore as well as surface, intermediate and mesopelagic water
samples. The results show a high abundance of mainly non photosynthetic species in
the oligotrophic Gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s like Alveolates (e.g. MALV II) and Stramenopiles (e.g.
Bicosoecida). In addition, the data reveal a pronounced shift in the community
composition of picoeukaryotes between coastal and offshore samples, over depth and
between water masses, revealing also the occurrence of the Levantine water mass in
the Gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s.
The manuscript is well written and requires no language editing. However, I strongly
recommend to be cautious when discussing the DGGE results and to add a small
